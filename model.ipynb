       "      <td>heze  china      first the news rippled across china that millions of compromised vaccines had been given to children around the country  then came grim rumors and angry complaints from parents that the government had kept them in the dark about the risks since last year  now  the country s immunization program faces a backlash of public distrust that critics say has been magnified by the government s ingrained secrecy  song zhendong  like many parents here  said he was reluctant to risk further vaccinations for his    son   if he can avoid them in the future  we will not get them   said mr  song  a businessman   why didn t we learn about this sooner  if there s a problem with vaccines for our kids  we should be told as soon as the police knew  aren t our children the future of the nation   the faulty vaccines have become the latest lightning rod for widespread  often visceral distrust of china s medical system  and a rebuff to what many chinese critics see as president xi jinping s bulldozing    rule  the scandal is just the latest crisis to shake public faith in china s food and medicine supplies  but it is the first big scare under mr  xi  who had vowed to be different  he came into office promising to  make protecting the people s right to health a priority     if our party can t even handle food safety properly while governing china  and this keeps up  some will wonder whether we re up to the job   mr  xi said in   the year he became president  the anger here in heze  the city in the eastern province of shandong where the scandal has its roots  is evident  about two million improperly stored vaccines were sold around the country from an overheated  dilapidated storeroom  the main suspect in the case is a hospital pharmacist from heze who had been convicted of trading in illegal vaccines in  and was doing it again two years later  many parents said they were especially alarmed that nearly a year had elapsed from the time the police uncovered the illicit trade and the time the public first learned about it in february   withholding information doesn t maintain public credibility   said li shuqing  a lawyer in jinan  the capital of shandong province  who is one of about  attorneys who have volunteered to represent possible victims in the case   in the end  it makes people more distrustful    to many here  the combination of lax regulation and the secrecy surrounding a potential public health crisis seems like déjà vu  in the sars crisis of    people died across mainland china and hundreds more died elsewhere after officials hid the extent of its spread  in a scandal that came to light in   at least six children died and    fell ill with kidney stones and other problems from infant formula adulterated with melamine  an industrial chemical   the customers worry about fake milk powder  fake medicine  fake vaccines  fake everything   said ma guohui  the owner of a shop on the rural fringe of heze that sells baby products   this is certainly going to affect people s thinking  my boy got all his vaccination shots  if he were born now  i d worry    despite such fears  the tainted vaccines are more likely to be ineffective than harmful  the world health organization has said that outdated or poorly stored vaccines rarely if ever trigger illness or toxic reactions  chinese government investigators said last week that they had not found any cases of adverse reactions or spikes in infections linked to ineffective vaccines  the greater danger may be more insidious  the erosion of public trust could damage china s immunization program  which has been credited with significant declines in measles and other communicable diseases   confidence is easy to shake  and that s happened across the world and has happened here   said lance rodewald  a doctor with the world health organization s immunization program in beijing   we hear through social media that parents are worried  and we know that when they re worried  there s a very good chance that they may think it s safer not to vaccinate than to vaccinate  that s when trouble can start    after unfounded reports of deaths caused by a hepatitis b vaccine in   such vaccinations across  provinces fell by  percent in the days afterward  and the administration of other mandatory vaccines fell by  percent  according to chinese health officials  the illicit vaccines in the current case were not part of china s compulsory    vaccination program  which inoculates children against illnesses such as polio and measles at no charge  the illegal trade dealt in     vaccines      including those for rabies  influenza and hepatitis b      which patients pay for from their own pockets  the pharmacist named in the investigation  pang hongwei  bought cheap vaccines from drug companies and traders      apparently batches close to their expiration dates      and sold them in  provinces and cities  according to drug safety investigators  she began the business in   just two years after she had been convicted on charges of illegally trading in vaccines and sentenced to three years in prison  which was reduced to five years  probation  officials have not explained how she was able to avoid prison and resume her business  ms  pang  in her late   and her daughter  who has been identified only by her surname  sun  kept the vaccines in a rented storeroom of a disused factory in jinan  the storeroom lacked refrigeration  which may have damaged the vaccines  potency  the police have detained them but not announced specific charges  and neither suspect has had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations  lax regulation in the   commercial system allowed ms  pang s business to grow  several medical experts said  local government medical agencies and clinics were able to increase their profits by turning to cheap  illegal suppliers  people s daily  the official party paper  reported on tuesday  police investigators discovered ms  pang s storehouse last april  but word did not get out to the public until a shandong news website reported on the case in february of this year  most chinese had still heard nothing about it until another website  the paper  published a report that drew national attention a month later  it was the government s intolerance of public criticism  critics said  that kept the scandal under wraps  a delay that now makes it harder to track those who received the suspect injections   we ve seen with these problem vaccines that without the right to know  without press freedom  the public s right to health can t be assured   said wang shengsheng  one of the lawyers pressing the government for more answers and redress over the case  in the last few weeks  official reticence has been supplanted by daily announcements of arrests  checks and assurances as the central government has scrambled to dampen public anger and alarm  premier li keqiang ordered central ministries and agencies in march to investigate what had gone wrong  last week  the investigators reported that  people had been detained over the scandal  and  officials dismissed  demoted or otherwise punished  health and drug officials promised to tighten vaccine purchase rules to stamp out    trade   how could this trafficking in vaccines outside the rules spread to so many places and go on for so long   mr  li said  according to an official account  without decisive action  he said   ordinary people will vote with their feet and go and buy the products they trust    mr  xi has so far not publicly commented on the scandal  dr  rodewald  the world health organization expert  said the proposed changes were promising and would mean clinics would not have to rely on selling   vaccines for their upkeep  xu huijin  a doctor in heze  said that the concern over the scandal      and unfounded rumors of deaths      had depressed the number of parents bringing children to her clinic for inoculations   this was badly handled   she said   there was a lack of coordination  not enough information  we should have found out about this long ago  doctors are taught to tell patients the full facts</td>\n",

       "      <td>lifeline  is a   thriller directed by an academy award winner about a man s search for his missing girlfriend  in the film  set in shanghai with a plot driven by corporate malfeasance  punches are thrown  shots are fired and people are killed  at one point  the actress olivia munn stands over a dead woman  blood on her hands  but this is no ordinary movie  it is an online advertisement for the mobile technology company qualcomm and  in particular  its snapdragon  chip set  a smartphone processor  as more people skip or block ads when streaming shows or browsing websites  advertisers are trying to find new ways to deliver their messages  the internet has long been a place where companies have tried to break out of the   and   ad model  but as it has become easier to present   videos online      and as top directors and actors have shown a willingness to be involved      these efforts have become more sophisticated  the goal of  lifeline  and similar ads is  to make something you want to see      and the holy grail is if people seek you out   said teddy lynn  chief creative officer for content and social at ogilvy  mather  which produced the film   this is a piece of entertainment that can compete in a very crowded marketplace     lifeline  was released in may and pushed out on multiple social media channels in the united states and china   inside lifeline   a      look at the film  is also available on the  lifeline  website  it emphasizes the importance of the cellphone to the action in the film and the phone s various features the film hopes to highlight  like its long battery life and improved photo capability  in many ways   lifeline  is just an extension of product placement and show sponsorship by advertisers that goes back to the early days of radio and television  said lou aversano  chief executive of ogilvy  mather ny   i think we continue to push  not just in terms of length  but in terms of the line between entertainment and brand message   he said  many companies are looking for ways to promote their brand through longer storytelling  such as johnnie walker  nike and prada  it is an impulse that dates to at least  or   when a series of eight   films for bmw starring clive owen appeared online   that was at the time the internet was still   said steve golin  founder and chief executive of anonymous content  a multimedia development company that produced the bmw ads and  lifeline     it would take all night to download     lifeline   which stars ms  munn  leehom wang and joan chen  is directed by armando bo  who won an oscar for best original screenplay for  birdman  in   the film has attracted  million views  there have been an additional  million combined views of the film s trailers and the    video  mr  lynn said  eighty percent of the views came from china  which was the primary market  the dialogue is  percent in chinese and  percent in english  mr  lynn said qualcomm would not disclose the cost of the ad  but noted that with less money needed to buy time on television  more was available for the production   you can create content that is compelling and you don t have to spend money to place it on tv   said mr  golin  whose company has been involved with movies like  spotlight  and  the revenant  and tv shows like  mr  robot     we think this is the direction advertising is headed  as long as sports exists  we will still do   and   commercials  but with most other entertainment there is a lot of resistance to watching    advertising    mark crispin miller  a professor of media studies at new york university  said the disappearing boundaries between advertising and entertainment could be troubling  ads  by their nature  often exaggerate  the benefits or virtues of the products and  even more troubling  downplay the dangers or risk of a product   mr  miller said  and using big stars  makes the commercial intent even harder to perceive and blurs the true purpose behind the work    still  more advertisers are eager to experiment  take  the ballad of the dreadnought   a   documentary about the distinctive guitar body originally manufactured by c  f  martin  company  it is narrated by jeff daniels and includes interviews with musicians like rosanne cash  stephen stills and steve miller  the film appears solely on martin s website  but was selected to appear at several film festivals  it has received    views since it first streamed on may   said scott byers  a managing partner at lehigh mining  navigation  the advertising agency that developed the film  the documentary idea developed  mr  byers said  when martin came to his agency wanting to celebrate the dreadnought guitar  which was developed in the early  century but never trademarked  enabling many other manufacturers to copy it over the years   they asked   what can we do to reclaim ownership of the shape     said denis aumiller  also a managing partner at the agency   the initial thought was that we would produce a short    product video  or maybe a magazine article    as enticing as it may be to think of every commercial as a potential short film that could play on the festival circuit  creating something that attracts viewers and promotes a product is not easy  entertainment  after all  is not the ultimate goal   at some point   mr  aversano said   there s a responsibility to deliver the message of the brand  otherwise it s just empty calories</td>\n",

       "33035  heze  china      first the news rippled across china that millions of compromised vaccines had been given to children around the country  then came grim rumors and angry complaints from parents that the government had kept them in the dark about the risks since last year  now  the country s immunization program faces a backlash of public distrust that critics say has been magnified by the government s ingrained secrecy  song zhendong  like many parents here  said he was reluctant to risk further vaccinations for his    son   if he can avoid them in the future  we will not get them   said mr  song  a businessman   why didn t we learn about this sooner  if there s a problem with vaccines for our kids  we should be told as soon as the police knew  aren t our children the future of the nation   the faulty vaccines have become the latest lightning rod for widespread  often visceral distrust of china s medical system  and a rebuff to what many chinese critics see as president xi jinping s bulldozing    rule  the scandal is just the latest crisis to shake public faith in china s food and medicine supplies  but it is the first big scare under mr  xi  who had vowed to be different  he came into office promising to  make protecting the people s right to health a priority     if our party can t even handle food safety properly while governing china  and this keeps up  some will wonder whether we re up to the job   mr  xi said in   the year he became president  the anger here in heze  the city in the eastern province of shandong where the scandal has its roots  is evident  about two million improperly stored vaccines were sold around the country from an overheated  dilapidated storeroom  the main suspect in the case is a hospital pharmacist from heze who had been convicted of trading in illegal vaccines in  and was doing it again two years later  many parents said they were especially alarmed that nearly a year had elapsed from the time the police uncovered the illicit trade and the time the public first learned about it in february   withholding information doesn t maintain public credibility   said li shuqing  a lawyer in jinan  the capital of shandong province  who is one of about  attorneys who have volunteered to represent possible victims in the case   in the end  it makes people more distrustful    to many here  the combination of lax regulation and the secrecy surrounding a potential public health crisis seems like déjà vu  in the sars crisis of    people died across mainland china and hundreds more died elsewhere after officials hid the extent of its spread  in a scandal that came to light in   at least six children died and    fell ill with kidney stones and other problems from infant formula adulterated with melamine  an industrial chemical   the customers worry about fake milk powder  fake medicine  fake vaccines  fake everything   said ma guohui  the owner of a shop on the rural fringe of heze that sells baby products   this is certainly going to affect people s thinking  my boy got all his vaccination shots  if he were born now  i d worry    despite such fears  the tainted vaccines are more likely to be ineffective than harmful  the world health organization has said that outdated or poorly stored vaccines rarely if ever trigger illness or toxic reactions  chinese government investigators said last week that they had not found any cases of adverse reactions or spikes in infections linked to ineffective vaccines  the greater danger may be more insidious  the erosion of public trust could damage china s immunization program  which has been credited with significant declines in measles and other communicable diseases   confidence is easy to shake  and that s happened across the world and has happened here   said lance rodewald  a doctor with the world health organization s immunization program in beijing   we hear through social media that parents are worried  and we know that when they re worried  there s a very good chance that they may think it s safer not to vaccinate than to vaccinate  that s when trouble can start    after unfounded reports of deaths caused by a hepatitis b vaccine in   such vaccinations across  provinces fell by  percent in the days afterward  and the administration of other mandatory vaccines fell by  percent  according to chinese health officials  the illicit vaccines in the current case were not part of china s compulsory    vaccination program  which inoculates children against illnesses such as polio and measles at no charge  the illegal trade dealt in     vaccines      including those for rabies  influenza and hepatitis b      which patients pay for from their own pockets  the pharmacist named in the investigation  pang hongwei  bought cheap vaccines from drug companies and traders      apparently batches close to their expiration dates      and sold them in  provinces and cities  according to drug safety investigators  she began the business in   just two years after she had been convicted on charges of illegally trading in vaccines and sentenced to three years in prison  which was reduced to five years  probation  officials have not explained how she was able to avoid prison and resume her business  ms  pang  in her late   and her daughter  who has been identified only by her surname  sun  kept the vaccines in a rented storeroom of a disused factory in jinan  the storeroom lacked refrigeration  which may have damaged the vaccines  potency  the police have detained them but not announced specific charges  and neither suspect has had a chance to respond publicly to the accusations  lax regulation in the   commercial system allowed ms  pang s business to grow  several medical experts said  local government medical agencies and clinics were able to increase their profits by turning to cheap  illegal suppliers  people s daily  the official party paper  reported on tuesday  police investigators discovered ms  pang s storehouse last april  but word did not get out to the public until a shandong news website reported on the case in february of this year  most chinese had still heard nothing about it until another website  the paper  published a report that drew national attention a month later  it was the government s intolerance of public criticism  critics said  that kept the scandal under wraps  a delay that now makes it harder to track those who received the suspect injections   we ve seen with these problem vaccines that without the right to know  without press freedom  the public s right to health can t be assured   said wang shengsheng  one of the lawyers pressing the government for more answers and redress over the case  in the last few weeks  official reticence has been supplanted by daily announcements of arrests  checks and assurances as the central government has scrambled to dampen public anger and alarm  premier li keqiang ordered central ministries and agencies in march to investigate what had gone wrong  last week  the investigators reported that  people had been detained over the scandal  and  officials dismissed  demoted or otherwise punished  health and drug officials promised to tighten vaccine purchase rules to stamp out    trade   how could this trafficking in vaccines outside the rules spread to so many places and go on for so long   mr  li said  according to an official account  without decisive action  he said   ordinary people will vote with their feet and go and buy the products they trust    mr  xi has so far not publicly commented on the scandal  dr  rodewald  the world health organization expert  said the proposed changes were promising and would mean clinics would not have to rely on selling   vaccines for their upkeep  xu huijin  a doctor in heze  said that the concern over the scandal      and unfounded rumors of deaths      had depressed the number of parents bringing children to her clinic for inoculations   this was badly handled   she said   there was a lack of coordination  not enough information  we should have found out about this long ago  doctors are taught to tell patients the full facts      \n",

his maiden trip to beijing  whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether  watched by trump and china s president xi jinping at a signing ceremony in beijing  u s  planemaker boeing co  general electric co and chip giant qualcomm inc sealed lucrative multi billion dollar deals   this is truly a miracle   china s commerce minister zhong shan said at a briefing in beijing  the quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world s second largest economy that he has long railed against and called  shockingly high  on thursday  but u s  businesses still have many long standing concerns to complain about  including unfettered access to the china market  cybersecurity and the growing presence of china s ruling communist party inside foreign firms  william zarit  chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china  said the deals pointed to  a strong  vibrant bilateral economic relationship  between the two countries   yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field  because u s  companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in china   u s  tech companies like facebook inc and google are mostly blocked in china  automakers ford motor co and general motors must operate through joint ventures  while hollywood movies face a strict quota system    these deals  allow trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker  while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship   hugo brennan  asia analyst at risk consultancy verisk maplecroft  said in a note  some huge deals were announced  among them is a  year    billion investment by china energy investment corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in west virginia  a major energy producing state that voted heavily for trump in the  election     the massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented   west virginia secretary of commerce h  wood thrasher said in a statement  it marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded china energy  which formed from the merger of china shenhua group  the country s largest coal producer and china guodian corp  one of china s top five utilities  however  as is often the case during state visits  many of the deals were packaged as  non binding  agreements  gave scant details or rolled over existing tie ups  helping pump up the headline figure   i am somewhat skeptical of such a large number   alex wolf  senior emerging markets economist at aberdeen standard investments  told the reuters global markets forum  adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been  positive    i suspect they might be primarily mous  memorandum of understandings  instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less   qualcomm signed non binding agreements worth   billion with xiaomi  oppo and vivo  three chinese handset makers that the firm said it had  longstanding relationships  with  qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in china  boeing announced a deal with state run china aviation suppliers holding co to sell  boeing jets with a valuation of   billion at list prices  though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders    interesting to see how many of those are past agreements purchase orders repackaged  beijing is a master of selling the same agreement  times   former mexican ambassador to china jorge guajardo posted on twitter  speaking alongside trump in beijing as they announced the deals  xi said the chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms  including those from the united states  and welcomed u s  companies to participate in his ambitious  belt and road  infrastructure led initiative  trump made clear he blamed his predecessors  not china  for allowing the u s  trade deficit to get  out of kilter   and repeatedly praised xi  calling him  a very special man    but we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us   trump said   xi smiled widely when trump said he does not blame china for the deficit  asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix american trade concerns in china  executives were cautiously optimistic   generally the sense was that this is all a good thing  and that s great   said gentry sayad  a shanghai based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in beijing    now let s see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward       \n",

                                                           it seems only natural that donald trump  the lowest rated president in modern history  should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much americans refuse to support him aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban  there s another policy that americans overwhelmingly despise   the american health care act  also known as trumpcare  while it s been widely known that americans prefer obamacare  the affordable care act  much more than trump s shady  disastrous alternative  the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought  it turns out  one poll states that over   of americans don t want trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones this recent poll cited that the american public s support for trumpcare is only    which basically means that trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of obamacare  almost half     of americans stated that they were against trumpcare  with most     responding that they were  strongly  opposed to it so while trump likes to brag about all this  winning  he s doing  we have yet to see it reflect in the american public s opinion of him and his policies  people are passionately resisting trumpcare  and have even taken to gop town halls to openly protest against and condemn gop lawmakers who are trying to help trump take out obamacare trump may not want to admit it  but he s dying in the polls  it s also been reported that only   of americans felt trump was right to fire fbi director james comey  and   of the public wanted the russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission the more trump tries  the more he fails  as time goes on  we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country featured image is a screenshot   \n",

election  the white house has announced that  intelligence operatives are being ejected from the country  in addition  sanctions will be placed on russia s two leading intelligence services  including four top officers of the military intelligence unit on thursday  obama signed an executive order which grants the president the authority to impose travel bans and asset freezes on those who  tamper with  alter  or cause a misappropriation of information  with a purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining election processes or institutions  the new york times reports mr  obama used that order to immediately impose sanctions on four russian intelligence officials  igor valentinovich korobov  the current chief of a military intelligence agency  the g r u   and three deputies  sergey aleksandrovich gizunov  the deputy chief of the g r u   igor olegovich kostyukov  a first deputy chief  and vladimir stepanovich alekseyev  also a first deputy chief of the g r u the administration also put sanctions on three companies and organizations that it said supported the hacking operations  the special technologies center  a signals intelligence operation in st  petersburg  a firm called zor security that is also known as esage lab  and the autonomous non commercial organization professional association of designers of data processing systems  whose lengthy name  american officials said  was cover for a group that provided special training for the hacking it is unclear at the moment how much of an impact these measures will actually have  the move may end up being largely symbolic  but as the times points out   the actions would amount to the strongest american response ever taken to a state sponsored cyberattack aimed at the united states  u s  intelligence agencies  including the cia  fbi  and department of homeland security  all agree that russia was behind the dnc hacks and the subsequent slow release of damaging information obtained in those hacks during the presidential campaign  they have also concluded that russia interfered with the election for one reason  to help donald trump defeat hillary clinton trump has blown off the findings of the u s  intelligence community as  ridiculous   because the punishments obama imposed today are an executive order  trump will have the option of nixing the sanctions when he takes office next month  if he chooses to do so  it is likely that members of congress  including republicans  will be furious as they have been calling for an official investigation into the matter the white house is also planning to release a joint analytic report  from the fbi and the department of homeland security which will give more insight into the information that has been gathered by the national security agency  the report is expected to be published before obama leaves office in three weeks featured image via chip somodevilla getty images   \n",

                               the main christian diocese in egypt has announced that it will not hold easter celebrations this year  in mourning for the  coptic christians killed in the palm sunday massacre brought about by twin jihadist bombings   the coptic orthodox diocese of minya  located in southern egypt  said tuesday that commemorations of the resurrection of jesus will be limited to the liturgical prayers  without any festive manifestations  out of respect for the faithful who were slain by suicide bombers of the islamic state   the minya province has the highest coptic christian population in the country and christians there traditionally hold easter vigil services on saturday evening and then spend easter sunday on large meals and family visits  christians in minya have lived in constant fear of attacks from the area s large salafi muslim population  in certain local villages  the faithful celebrate mass before a cross drawn on a wall  making it easy to erase quickly in order to avoid attacks  police sources said that  people have been arrested for their possible ties to the planning and financing of sunday s attacks  using dna testing  authorities have also identified the two perpetrators of the slaughter as egyptians who had traveled to syria yet managed to return to egypt  bypassing border controls  the two jihadis carried out separate suicide bombings in the churches of saint george in tanta and saint mark in alexandria while palm sunday services were being conducted  the attacks took the lives of  people  and left more than a hundred wounded  one of the terrorists was identified with the nom de guerre of abu ishaaq al masri  and was reportedly born in  in the province of sharqiya  located in the nile delta north of cairo  he is thought to have entered syria in january of  before authorities lost track of his whereabouts  the bombing in alexandria was reportedly the work of abu     who blew himself up near the doors of the church just as he passed through the metal detector  according to the man s relatives  he had made several trips to neighboring libya  where he would stay for three months at a time  on tuesday  the egyptian parliament unanimously ratified the state of emergency that had been declared the prior evening by the cabinet of ministers of president abdel fattah    the state of alert will be in force for the next three months  at which time it may be renewed if need be  the state of emergency gives the president wide and exceptional powers to establish special courts  intercept communications  impose censorship  or even decree a curfew  human rights activists have expressed fears that the state of emergency will add even more repression to a country where public freedoms have been crushed in the last four years under the pretext of fighting increasingly widespread terrorism  the pew research center reported tuesday that egypt is now the country with the highest level of government restrictions of religion in the entire world  meanwhile  the islamic state has become more and more active in egypt  especially in the region of north sinai  and recently vowed to step up its attacks against egypt s christians  along with the palm sunday attack  isis had claimed responsibility for the december  bombing of a church next to st  mark s cathedral in cairo  an important religious site for egyptian copts  that

             mccarthyism has returned donald trump is literally letting a white nationalist publication dictate personnel decisions in his administration sahar nowrouzzadeh is an american citizen of iranian descent  she is an expert on iran and has played a crucial role in shaping u s  policy in the middle east  she was born in america  first served at the state department under the george w  bush administration in  and was on the team that negotiated the iran nuclear deal under president obama but because she is of iranian descent  breitbart and other conservative outlets believe she is in league with iranian leadership against the united states  seriously according to politico nowrouzzadehad had been detailed since last july to the secretary of state s policy planning team  where she handled ongoing issues related to iran and gulf arab countries  her yearlong assignment was cut short earlier this month  after critical stories about her and others appeared in the conservative review and on breitbart news  according to the state department official  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter  nowrouzzadeh did not want to be reassigned  according to the official indeed  being reassigned is basically a demotion and one based on racism and fear instead of one based on her job performance nowrouzzadeh will now be working in the office of iranian affairs despite the state department praising her work as  valuable in furtherance of u s  national security  nowrouzzadeh is the kind of state department employee america needs right now as tensions between iran and the united states remain strained because trump and his republican allies have repeatedly threatened to trash the nuclear deal former state department official phillip gordon slammed the trump administration for caving to pressure from conservative media  like many civil service experts and career foreign service officers  she possesses just the sort of expertise political leaders from either party should have by their side when they make critical and difficult foreign policy decisions   gordon said the bottom line is that this smacks of mccarthyism from the right wing just as it did when joe mccarthy led a witch hunt against government employees in pursuit of alleged communists only this time  conservatives are targeting anyone who has a name that sounds middle eastern or muslim breitbart should not have the power to affect personnel decisions at the state department and donald trump should not listen to them  doing so only makes us weaker because the experts we need on the front lines are being persecuted or living in fear of being persecuted it also makes america less safe because this demotion will be used as an example of how the current united states government treats people of middle eastern descent in order to recruit terrorists sahar nowrouzzadeh already swore an oath to defend the united states constitution when she was hired by the state department in   it s the same oath that members of congress swear when they enter office  questioning her loyalty based on the color of her skin or her birth name is wrong and constitutes discrimination  frankly  she should file a lawsuit against trump featured image  olivier douliery pool getty images   \n",

nomination  thousands of republicans will either refuse to vote for him or vote for democrats to keep donald trump from taking over their party and ultimately the oval office  but mr  trump s campaign  along with senator ted cruz who is also despised by many of his republican colleagues and supporters of the party  have pulled republicans far to the right  leaving moderate republicans with nowhere to turn but the democratic party republicans currently have a majority in both the house and the senate  congress has been in gridlock since they took over  the gop majority has consistently refused to do their jobs  they are more focused on obstructing president obama than working with democrats to solve the pressing problems facing our nation  this november  those do nothing republicans will pay the price by losing elections across the country  in addition to the presidential election republicans love to do nothing  so the democrats will help them achieve those ambitions of doing nothing by no longer allowing them to be employed in congress  despite the pressing and timely concerns posed by the threat of climate change  republicans refuse to acknowledge its existence and do nothing  when religious nutjob kim davis refused to do her job as a county clerk charged with issuing marriage licenses in kentucky  republicans applauded her propensity for not doing her job  when paul ryan became speaker of the house  republicans forced him to promise to not do anything on immigration reform  and bow to the party leaders  wishes for congress to continue to do nothing better than before despite mass shootings occurring all over the country on a regular basis  the republican party has refused to take any action on gun control or mental health issues   every meaningful proposal or reform that is introduced into songress is met with staunch resistance from the republican party  who refuses to act to help solve or mitigate any of the issues facing the country  with the republican majority gone  democrats can finally start solving some of the country s problems featured image via flickr   \n",

girlfriend  in the film  set in shanghai with a plot driven by corporate malfeasance  punches are thrown  shots are fired and people are killed  at one point  the actress olivia munn stands over a dead woman  blood on her hands  but this is no ordinary movie  it is an online advertisement for the mobile technology company qualcomm and  in particular  its snapdragon  chip set  a smartphone processor  as more people skip or block ads when streaming shows or browsing websites  advertisers are trying to find new ways to deliver their messages  the internet has long been a place where companies have tried to break out of the   and   ad model  but as it has become easier to present   videos online      and as top directors and actors have shown a willingness to be involved      these efforts have become more sophisticated  the goal of  lifeline  and similar ads is  to make something you want to see      and the holy grail is if people seek you out   said teddy lynn  chief creative officer for content and social at ogilvy  mather  which produced the film   this is a piece of entertainment that can compete in a very crowded marketplace     lifeline  was released in may and pushed out on multiple social media channels in the united states and china   inside lifeline   a      look at the film  is also available on the  lifeline  website  it emphasizes the importance of the cellphone to the action in the film and the phone s various features the film hopes to highlight  like its long battery life and improved photo capability  in many ways   lifeline  is just an extension of product placement and show sponsorship by advertisers that goes back to the early days of radio and television  said lou aversano  chief executive of ogilvy  mather ny   i think we continue to push  not just in terms of length  but in terms of the line between entertainment and brand message   he said  many companies are looking for ways to promote their brand through longer storytelling  such as johnnie walker  nike and prada  it is an impulse that dates to at least  or   when a series of eight   films for bmw starring clive owen appeared online   that was at the time the internet was still   said steve golin  founder and chief executive of anonymous content  a multimedia development company that produced the bmw ads and  lifeline     it would take all night to download     lifeline   which stars ms  munn  leehom wang and joan chen  is directed by armando bo  who won an oscar for best original screenplay for  birdman  in   the film has attracted  million views  there have been an additional  million combined views of the film s trailers and the    video  mr  lynn said  eighty percent of the views came from china  which was the primary market  the dialogue is  percent in chinese and  percent in english  mr  lynn said qualcomm would not disclose the cost of the ad  but noted that with less money needed to buy time on television  more was available for the production   you can create content that is compelling and you don t have to spend money to place it on tv   said mr  golin  whose company has been involved with movies like  spotlight  and  the revenant  and tv shows like  mr  robot     we think this is the direction advertising is headed  as long as sports exists  we will still do   and   commercials  but with most other entertainment there is a lot of resistance to watching    advertising    mark crispin miller  a professor of media studies at new york university  said the disappearing boundaries between advertising and entertainment could be troubling  ads  by their nature  often exaggerate  the benefits or virtues of the products and  even more troubling  downplay the dangers or risk of a product   mr  miller said  and using big stars  makes the commercial intent even harder to perceive and blurs the true purpose behind the work    still  more advertisers are eager to experiment  take  the ballad of the dreadnought   a   documentary about the distinctive guitar body originally manufactured by c  f  martin  company  it is narrated by jeff daniels and includes interviews with musicians like rosanne cash  stephen stills and steve miller  the film appears solely on martin s website  but was selected to appear at several film festivals  it has received    views since it first streamed on may   said scott byers  a managing partner at lehigh mining  navigation  the advertising agency that developed the film  the documentary idea developed  mr  byers said  when martin came to his agency wanting to celebrate the dreadnought guitar  which was developed in the early  century but never trademarked  enabling many other manufacturers to copy it over the years   they asked   what can we do to reclaim ownership of the shape     said denis aumiller  also a managing partner at the agency   the initial thought was that we would produce a short    product video  or maybe a magazine article    as enticing as it may be to think of every commercial as a potential short film that could play on the festival circuit  creating something that attracts viewers and promotes a product is not easy  entertainment  after all  is not the ultimate goal   at some point   mr  aversano said   there s a responsibility to deliver the message of the brand  otherwise it s just empty calories      \n",

       "      <td>a dozen politically active pastors came here for a private dinner friday night to hear a conversion story unique in the context of presidential politics  how louisiana gov  bobby jindal traveled from hinduism to protestant christianity and  ultimately  became what he calls an  evangelical catholic    over two hours  jindal    recalled talking with a girl in high school who wanted to  save my soul   reading the bible in a closet so his parents would not see him and feeling a stir while watching a movie during his senior year that depicted jesus on the cross    i was struck  and struck hard   jindal told the pastors   this was the son of god  and he had died for our sins    jindal s session with the christian clergy  who lead congregations in the early presidential battleground states of iowa and south carolina  was part of a behind the scenes effort by the louisiana governor to find a political base that could help propel him into the top tier of republican candidates seeking to run for the white house in    known in gop circles mostly for his mastery of policy issues such as health care  jindal  a rhodes scholar and graduate of the ivy league s brown university  does not have an obvious pool of activist supporters to help drive excitement outside his home state  so he is harnessing his religious experience in a way that has begun to appeal to parts of the gop s influential core of religious conservatives  many of whom have yet to find a favorite among the republicans eyeing the presidential race   other potential  gop candidates are wooing the evangelical base  including sens  rand paul  ky   and ted cruz  tex   and indiana gov  mike pence   but over the weekend in lynchburg   a mecca of sorts for evangelicals as the home of liberty university  founded in the  by the rev  jerry falwell   jindal appeared to make progress   in addition to his dinner with the pastors  he delivered a well received  call to action  address to   christian conservatives gathered for liberty s commencement ceremony  talking again about his faith while assailing what he said was president obama s record of attacking religious liberty   the pastors who came to meet jindal said his intimate descriptions of his experiences stood out    he has the convictions  and he has what it takes to communicate them   said brad sherman of solid rock christian church in coralville  iowa  sherman helped former arkansas governor mike huckabee in his winning  campaign for delegates in iowa   another huckabee admirer  the rev  c  mitchell brooks of second baptist church in belton  s c   said jindal s commitment to christian values and his compelling story put him  on a par  with huckabee  who was a baptist preacher before entering politics   the visiting pastors flew to lynchburg over the weekend at the invitation of the american renewal project  a well funded nonprofit group that encourages evangelical christians to engage in the civic arena with voter guides  get out the vote drives and programs to train pastors in grass roots activism  the group s founder  david lane  has built a pastor network in politically important states such as iowa  missouri  ohio and south carolina and has led trips to israel with paul and others seeking to make inroads with evangelical activists   the group that lane invited to lynchburg included donald wild mon  a retired minister and founder of the american family association  a prominent evangelical activist group that has influence through its network of more than  christian radio stations   most of the pastors that lane s organization brought to lynchburg had not met jindal  but they said he captured their interest recently when he stepped forward to defend phil robertson  patriarch of the  duck dynasty  television show family  amid a controversy over disparaging remarks he made about gays in an interview with gq magazine   throughout his lynchburg visit  jindal presented himself as a willing culture warrior   during his commencement address saturday  he took up the cause of twin brothers whose hgtv reality series about renovating and reselling houses   flip it forward   was canceled last week after a web site revealed that they had protested against same sex marriage at the  democratic national convention in charlotte   the siblings  jason and david benham  both liberty graduates  attended the graduation and a private lunch with jindal  who called the action against them  another demonstration of intolerance from the entertainment industry     if these guys had protested at the republican party convention  instead of canceling their show  hgtv would probably have given them a raise   jindal said as the liberty crowd applauded   he cited the hobby lobby craft store chain  which faced a legal challenge after refusing to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives as required under the affordable care act  members of the family that owns hobby lobby  who have become heroes to many religious conservatives  have said that they are morally opposed to the use of certain types of birth control and that they considered the requirement a violation of their first amendment right to religious freedom   the family was  committed to honor the lord by being generous employers  paying well above minimum wage and increasing salaries four years in a row even in the midst of the enduring recession   jindal told the liberty graduates   none of this matters to the obama administration    but for the pastors who came to see jindal in action  the governor s own story was the highlight of the weekend  and in many ways  he was unlike any other aspiring president these activists had met   piyush jindal was born in   four months after his parents arrived in baton rouge  la   from their native india  he changed his name to bobby as a young boy  adopting the name of a character on a favorite television show   the brady bunch    his decision to become a christian  he told the pastors  did not come in one moment of lightning epiphany  instead  he said  it happened in phases  growing from small seeds planted over time   jindal recalled that his closest friend from grade school gave him a bible with his name emblazoned in gold on the cover as a christmas present  it struck him initially as an unimpressive gift  jindal told the pastors    who in the world would spend good money for a bible when everyone knows you can get one free in any hotel   he recalled thinking at the time   and the gold lettering meant i couldn t give it away or return it    his religious education reached a higher plane during his junior year in high school  he told his dinner audience  he wanted to ask a pretty girl on a date during a hallway conversation  and she started talking about her faith in god and her opposition to abortion  the girl invited him to visit her church   jindal said he was skeptical and set out to  investigate all these fanciful claims  made by the girl and other friends  he started reading the bible in his closet at home   i was unsure how my parents would react   he said   after the stirring moment when he saw christ depicted on the cross during the religious movie  the bible and his very existence suddenly seemed clearer to him  jindal told the pastors   jindal did not dwell on his subsequent conversion to catholicism just a few years later in college  where he said he immersed himself in the traditions of the church   he touched on it briefly during the commencement address  noting in passing that  i am best described as an evangelical catholic   mostly  he sought to showcase the ways in which he shares values with other christian conservatives    i read the words of jesus christ  and i realized that they were true   jindal told the graduates saturday  offering a less detailed accounting of his conversion than he had done the night before with the pastors   i used to think that i had found god  but i believe it is more accurate to say that he found me</td>\n",

       "      <td>the atlantic  a publication that wouldn t know unbiased journalism if it bit them in the a   published what appears to be a reluctant piece on president trump s outstanding accomplishments during his first  months in office  most of the people reading this piece by the atlantic are fans of their writing because they ve bought into the progressive  anti american sentiment they were fed like crack cocaine in college  almost like the patch that smokers wear to help them get through the withdrawal of nicotine while going through a cessation program  the atlantic provides their readers with enough anti trump propaganda to keep them in business  while acting like a support group for their readers  who fear every anti american piece of legislation barack obama worked so hard to implement  is all unraveling  thanks to this guy who  foolishly  wants  make america great again   of course  in the eyes of the atlantic reader  america was never great to begin with the parts where the atlantic talks about president trump s accomplishments are italicized and the comments the writer makes to counter trump s successes have been highlighted the atlantic starts out the article by giving credit to trump s  shadow government   as somehow being responsible for his amazing successes in his first  months  according to the atlantic  the  actual government  is the fake news stories and the obsession with negative chatter surrounding trump s presidency  while president trump s accomplishments have been hidden in the  shadows  the atlantic  imagine  if you will  that there is a shadow government the actual government  the administration of donald trump  is coming off the worst week of his presidency  although there haven t been any smooth weeks  trump s top legislative priority  repealing and replacing the affordable care act  seems dead for the moment   tax reform  forget it   his administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction  rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through  well  legislative initiatives  trump s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective  meanwhile  a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration  threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members things are going considerably better for the shadow government  with the trump administration s chaos sucking up all the attention  it s been able to move forward on a range of its priorities  which tend to be more focused on regulatory matters anyway  it is remaking the justice system  rewriting environmental rules  overhauling public lands administration  and greenlighting major infrastructure projects  it is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come  let s consider the trump administration s accomplishments  spoiler alert  like climate change  they re real one of the two biggest victories has come on border security  which was one of trump s top campaign priorities  border crossings have already plummeted  suggesting that rhetoric making it clear to immigrants that they are not welcome is effective in its own right  customs and border protections report that apprehensions of unauthorized people are down nearly  percent from the same time in    trump continues to radically exaggerate these figures  though   this decline has occurred despite trump being foiled on his actual policy proposals at the border  construction hasn t begun on his border wall yet  and federal courts have repeatedly smacked down his muslim travel ban that said  he did get one good result in courts and that points to a second area of success  the supreme court allowed parts of the travel ban to go forward  in a victory that would not have happened without neil gorsuch on the court  filling a seat that under all previous customs would have been filled by barack obama s appointee merrick garland  given his legislative struggles  the most enduring trump victories are likely to come in the judicial branch trump may get to appoint several more justices to the high court  and in the meantime  he s filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees  as the veteran democratic official ron klain wrote recently   a massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary  for while president trump is incompetent at countless aspects of his job  he is proving wildly successful in one respect  naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record setting numbers  there are the quiet  far reaching changes  getting back to pruitt  the environment is one of the places where the trump administration has had its largest impact  the most prominent move was trump s june  announcement that the u s  will withdraw from the paris climate accord  but the epa is moving on other fronts as well  it s working to dismantle barack obama s clean power plan  a signature policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions  in june  following a february executive order from trump  the epa began the process of rescinding the  waters of the united states rule  which aimed at protecting smaller bodies of water and streams in the same way that larger ones had been  in december  in the closing weeks of his administration  obama banned drilling in the arctic and parts of the atlantic ocean  the trump administration promptly set about undoing that ban   how interested oil companies will be remains to be seen  the new york times found in june that pruitt s epa  has moved to undo  delay or otherwise block more than  environmental rules  a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency s  year history   and it might have done more if not for constraints imposed by judges  epa tried to abandon an obama era rule on methane emissions  but a court on monday forced it to continue enforcing the rule other agencies are also in on the environmental deregulation act  the state department reversed an obama era decision  clearing the way for the keystone xl pipeline to begin construction  the interior department is considering reversing a rule on fracking on public lands  and might also reverse some equipment regulations on offshore drilling equipment implemented after the  gulf oil spill  the department has rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands although the justice department had staunchly opposed a texas voting law that has repeatedly been smacked down by courts as discriminatory  sessions switched the department s position  and it has now told courts the law ought to be allowed to remain  the attorney general has also sought to cut off funding to so called sanctuary cities  though his legal authority to do so is disputed curiously  since he campaigned as an atypically lgbt friendly republican  trump has also made a range of changes on gay issues  last week alone  the justice department announced that sexual orientation was not covered by section vii  and the president said that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military  the administration has also rejected obama era protections for transgender students</td>\n",

actual record and policies of hillary clinton as secretary of state with this week s damning revelations regarding gulf arab monarchs buying access into the us state dept via the clinton foundation  a clearer picture is now emerging about how the sponsorship of religious extremism  as well as geopolitical instability in the middle east and beyond   links directly back to the clinton global network of international oligarchs  watch this week s abc news segment  based on this line of inquiry  what will four years of a clinton presidency bring in terms of us foreign policy  a few answers to this question from global research  andre vltchek global researchif the west in general and the united states in particular  left the arab and muslim world alone and in peace  we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks  which are rocking the world from indonesia to france  there would be no mujahedeen and its mutation into al qaeda  in afghanistan or elsewhere  there would be no traces of the isis  or isil or i s  or daesh or however you choose to call it   in syria  iraq  libya or anywhere else and the super conservative wahhabi islam  that outdated  freak saudi mutant  would remain in the religious schools of the ultra regressive kingdom  instead of gaining ground all over southeast asia  the middle east and africa secular islambut the west embarked on a brutal  machiavellian path  it decided to destroy socialist islam   that  historically  moderate  compassionate and progressive religion  it smashed once secular egypt  it overthrew the government in socialist iran and then in near communist indonesia  implanting in all these places horrifically degenerate and fully outdated religious concepts  it used extremists to destroy healthy patriotism and socialism  like the brits in the  century   you can control people s brains  while we will control your natural resources    the west embraced wahhabi teaching  because it was able to guarantee full obedience  dictatorial  pro western  governance and oppressive feudalism islam has been used and abused  manipulated and virtually stripped of its essence  the process has gone so far that two leading iranian scholars  during my visit last year to tehran  declared to me   in so many parts of the world  the west created an absolutely new religion  we don t recognize it  anymore  it has nothing to do with islam  if the west in general and the united states in particular  left the arab and muslim world alone and in peace  we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks  which are rocking the world from indonesia to france correct  like a naughty  spoiled and heartless child  the west  after destroying the soviet union  painstakingly constructed its new enemy    militant islam    so it could continue indulging in its favorite activity  which is perpetual conflict  endless wars and plunder it is as simple as that the greatest oppressors of the muslim people  those in saudi arabia  bahrain  and indonesia have all been closely allied to the west  the most terrible terrorist  muslim  organizations  from al qaida to isis  have been created  armed and supported by the west and its cronies in europe and in the united states  the  fear of terrorists  is fully exploited by the western regime   a global class alliance of plutocrats  in actuality  with headquarters in washington  where the main military and media muscle reside  it still clings to power mainly thanks to such fear implanted in the brains of  ordinary people  and what about the  war on terror   yes  there really is such war  but the west is not the one who fights it  as this goes to print  the war against terrorism is being fought by russia  iran  china  syria  hezbollah and their allies the west is still closely collaborating with the terrorists  it miraculously  avoids targeting them  when  fighting wars against them   it financially supports some and trains others  it criticizes and antagonizes those who are actually fighting the extremist militant groups extremists have been unleashed  like rottweiler fighting dogs  against almost all progressive governments in the middle east  but also against china and russia  extremist muslims  extremist christians  even extremist buddhists in turn  the politicians in the united states are regularly supported  financially  by the regimes  including those of saudi arabia  bahrain  etc   that are spreading  relentlessly  throughout the world  the most intolerant and grotesquely violent religious concepts despite their essential servility and cowardice  even some north american mainstream media outlets are now actively discussing various schemes involving the financing of the clinton foundation by saudi arabia  alongside several leading transnational corporations and wall street s largest banks  on its  breaking news   as far back as in   cnn reported the donations to the william j  clinton foundation include amounts of   million to   million from the kingdom of saudi arabia  the bill and melinda gates foundation and real estate mogul stephen bing  a personal friend of the clintons the clintons came under intense pressure during hillary clinton s campaign for the democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the foundation and to the clinton presidential library in arkansas bill clinton agreed to the release of the list after president elect barack obama nominated hillary clinton to become secretary of state the governments of kuwait and qatar are also on the list  as is saudi businessman nasser al rashid  who has close ties to the saudi royal family  saudi sheikh mohammed h  al amoudi  reputed to be one of the richest men in the world  is among the donors as well  both saudis contributed in the   million to   million range  a group called friends of saudi arabia and the dubai foundation appear in the same category   as recently as on august     the new york times wrote something similar  essentially reconfirming the validity of the earlier reports  while adding many more details and adjusting the figures  the kingdom of saudi arabia donated more than   million  through a foundation  so did the son in law of a former ukrainian president whose government was widely criticized for corruption and the murder of journalists  a lebanese nigerian developer with vast business interests contributed as much as   million for years the bill  hillary and chelsea clinton foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity  but now  as mrs  clinton seeks the white house  the funding of the sprawling philanthropy has become an achilles  heel for her campaign and  if she is victorious  potentially her administration as well  long time clinton s top aide  huma abedin  who spent part of her childhood in saudi arabia  has been an intermediary between the former secretary of state and pro saudi interests  she also negotiated financial support for ms  clinton from mr  chagouri and other individuals  organizations and businesses originating from the middle east the accusations and evidence keep coming in  from different media outlets  both left wing and right wing  on august     the conservative breitbart news stated  khizr khan  the muslim gold star father that the mainstream media and former secretary of state hillary clinton have been using to criticize donald j  trump  has deep ties to the government of saudi arabia and to international islamist investors through his own law firm  in addition to those ties to the wealthy islamist nation  khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the united states and has deep ties to the  clinton cash  narrative through the clinton foundation    hillary s saudi sponsorshillary clinton s dependence on saudi sponsors has been strongly influencing her decision to maintain a foreign policy in the service of riyadh and support for various terrorist groups controlled by saudi arabia and qatar  in and beyond the middle east region  in reality  she is simply representing  continuity  of an already existing  deadly trend  the regime has been  evolving  for decades  but especially since the ronald reagan years  republicans or democrats  it truly matters very little  both parties spread terror all over the world  true  george w  bush invaded iraq  but people like bill clinton are close friends and supporters of paul kagame  the rwandese  butcher of congo   with the blood of some  million people on his hands  democrat and  moderate   bill clinton  was also responsible for the criminal bombing and destruction of socialist yugoslavia  and so it goes but under barack obama s rule  the last hope for an independent middle east and the arab world has virtually evaporated  libya has been destroyed  the syrian civil war was launched from washington  london and paris  saudis bathed rebellious yemen in blood using uk and us produced weapons  virtually all  arab spring revolutions  were infiltrated and diverted  and in bahrain  the shi a majority was literally raped by saudi arabia and its own ruthless rulers  with british advisors standing by the us and europe have kept selling arms to the gulf  building new military bases while supporting the most appalling and bloodthirsty regimes the  obama   hilary  clinton era  has greatly  improved  the symbioses of western imperialism  big business  and pro western fascist regimes worldwide  but particularly in the middle east and africa this toxic embrace has proved fatal to millions of people in these two parts of the world  hopes for self governance have been ruined  corpses keep piling up in syria  iraq  libya  yemen  south sudan  somalia  the democratic republic of congo  drc   and elsewhere the west does not care  as long as it stays in charge of the  show   and for as long as hundreds of billions of dollars are made by weapons  producers  even if millions are dying  there is still an uninterrupted flow of raw materials to the west and japan  therefore  it is  business as usual    un people  and their lives are worth nothing at one point  russia  iran  china and others have said  enough is enough  let s fight against the true terrorists  let s fight isis and other bigots  let s give a hand to the independence minded  socially oriented patriots  predictably   this led to total outrage in washington  london  and paris  and tokyo   disobedience and rebellion against the global  western  order could not be tolerated  it had to be crushed  even at the cost of new and deadly world war nato  washington  europe  japan  and south korea  all started a direct confrontation policy against russia  china  iran  north korea  dprk  and other members of the  coalition of daring   brazil  an important member of brics  was recently destroyed by the extreme right coup supported by the west even the republican presidential candidate donald trump  in his rare moments of sanity  is clearly aware of the danger  he does not wish to confront russia  he is obviously not willing to sacrifice tens of millions of human lives for some grotesque dreams of total world domination by a market fundamentalism backed by the white  or western  supremacist dogmas but trump s moments of sanity are defined as  madness  by the mainstream propaganda  not surprisingly  as was correctly stated by the great indian thinker  arundhati roy  some several years ago   now war is called peace and black is called white   orwellian indeed  with a vengeance the clinton campaignthe clinton campaign has gone into overdrive  it attempts to distract attention from its own funding scandals  by accusing donald trump s aides of receiving financing from abroad  trump is now described as  russia s agent  this game   it is all self serving  nothing to do with the interests of the world  or even the interests of the common  american people  for as long as the general political trend of the west does not radically change  or for as long as the west is not stopped by outside forces  perpetual wars will continue  monstrous genocides in africa  the destruction of entire states and regions in the middle east  all this could easily spread to other parts of the planet it is clear now that if provoked and confronted  countries like china  russia and iran would not hesitate to fight back  they also may fight for others   for their tortured allies the western implants and their buddies  mujahedeen al qaida  have already destroyed afghanistan and the soviet union  isis  another mutant unleashed by the west and its allies  have been devastating iraq  syria  libya and now what is left of afghanistan these  movements  have really nothing to do with islam  they were manufactured in washington  riyadh  london  and doha  and most likely even in tel aviv   for several concrete purposes  all of them thoroughly foul they are making sure to ruin the socialist nature of islam  insisting exclusively on the implementation of outdated  medieval

well as laws prohibiting child marriage and marital rape  during her visit to ksa  hillary clinton spoke at the islamic college of dar el hekma  where dr  saleha abedin was a vice dean  shoulder to shoulder with her favorite aide   huma was this just an insignificant episode  like those millions of dollars in saudi arabian funding for clinton s foundation  like the us  foreign policy  in the gulf and in the middle east  like spreading muslim extremist groups to all corners of the world  from africa  the middle east  to southeast asia and even china  like unleashing conservative islam against socialist muslim countries too many  episodes   too much blood  it is time to say what is by now obvious   the us establishment is not fighting  muslim terrorism  or even  extremism   it is

choose  a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former president barack obama s signature health law  but the plan was attacked by democrats as a step back from the affordable care act s protections  and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible  if anything  the proposal      by senators bill cassidy of louisiana  a medical doctor  and susan collins of maine  a moderate republican      may show how difficult it will be for republicans to enact a replacement for the affordable care act  legislation that can pass muster in the more conservative house may not win enough support in the senate  a bill with broad appeal in the senate may fail in the house  under the proposal  states could stay with the affordable care act  or they could receive a similar amount of federal money  which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance   we are moving the locus of repeal to state government   mr  cassidy said   states should have the right to choose    the proposal shares some features with house republican proposals  it would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and eliminate the requirement for most americans to have insurance or pay a tax penalty  but the option for states to keep the affordable care act alive will rankle the most conservative republicans who have been trying for nearly seven years to blow it up   obamacare is flawed  failing and not fixable  and it needs to be fully repealed   said representative mark meadows of north carolina  the chairman of the house freedom caucus  a stalemate between the house and senate would leave in place mr  obama s health law  but efforts by president trump and congress to undermine it could send health insurance markets into a tailspin  on friday  as one of his first official acts as president  mr  trump signed an executive order that could allow officials to ease up on enforcement of the mandate requiring most americans to have insurance  supporters of the affordable care act panned the   proposal   millions of americans would be kicked off their plans     costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket  and protections for people with   conditions  such as cancer  would be gutted   said the senate democratic leader  chuck schumer of new york  ronald f  pollack  the executive director of families usa  a   consumer group  said the bill  falls way short of providing the protections and coverage people have under the affordable care act    ms  collins said the bill would allow states to  keep the affordable care act if it is working for their residents    but she predicted that most states would choose something different  under the   bill  states could enroll people who would otherwise be uninsured in health plans providing basic coverage  these   health plans are intended to protect consumers against catastrophic medical expenses  they would cover generic versions of prescription drugs  and they would also have to cover recommended childhood immunizations without    states would contract with one or more insurers to offer this coverage  consumers could buy  more robust coverage  if they want  mr  cassidy said  but they could be automatically enrolled  by default  in the   health plans providing basic coverage   a state could say   all those eligible are enrolled unless they choose not to be    he explained  this  passive enrollment  would provide insurers with a large pool of customers  including many healthy people  without the coercion of an  individual mandate   mr  cassidy said   we think that we could cover more people than obamacare   mr  cassidy said  although he acknowledged that the effects of his bill had not been analyzed by the congressional budget office  which serves as capitol hill s official scorekeeper  if a state opts out of the affordable care act  many of the federal insurance standards established under the law would no longer apply  the bill would repeal federal benefit mandates that  often force americans to pay for coverage they don t need and can t afford   mr  cassidy said  but some protections would remain in place  parents would still be allowed to keep children on their insurance until the age of   and insurers could not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits  the   bill  called the patient freedom act  would eliminate not only the unpopular individual mandate  but also the federal requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to   employees  mr  cassidy said that senators shelley moore capito of west virginia and johnny isakson of georgia  both republicans  were also sponsors of the bill  the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky  and the no   senate republican  john cornyn of texas  were sponsors of a similar bill that mr  cassidy introduced in   but the legislative landscape is different now  republicans in congress can repeal the affordable care act  with support from mr  trump  in the senate  they will need help from democrats to adopt a replacement because republicans are eight votes shy of the  needed to stop

traders increased their investments in risky debt without his knowledge  instead  mr  thiam said  the firm should dedicate itself to cultivating billionaires in china  indonesia and africa  the message  the future for the company is in managing the wealth of others  one year in  credit suisse stock is down  percent  and the investment bank  the second largest in switzerland after ubs  is in open revolt  credit suisse has a wide range of businesses  like overseeing the fortunes of billionaires and managing initial public offerings for technology companies  but for decades  the bank has been dominated  both culturally and financially  by a richly paid banking elite  these deal makers in new york and london are now furious at mr  thiam  not just for cutting their pay but also because they resent his blaming them for the   billion in losses that the firm has suffered on his watch  across europe  banking giants like barclays  deutsche bank  ubs and royal bank of scotland have  to varying degrees  moved away from traditional investment banking activities because of increased regulation and volatile markets  sluggish growth in large european economies      not to mention the remarkable phenomenon of negative interest rates      have not helped matters  either  but what makes the situation at credit suisse stand out is that mr  thiam appears to have done little to cloak his disdain for these activities  the question is not whether mr  thiam is right to grab power and capital from these declining businesses but whether his blunt  domineering style as a change agent will end up alienating bankers instead of winning them over   it is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic   said guy moszkowski  a longtime securities analyst at autonomous research  by any measure  mr  thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank  born to a prominent family in ivory coast  he cut short a career at mckinsey  company in paris in  to join a   government in his home country as a top banker and minister  following a military coup in   mr  thiam returned to mckinsey  and in   he was named chief executive of prudential  the british insurance conglomerate      becoming the first african to head a major listed company in britain     and snugly tailored  mr  thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools  he had a successful run at prudential  no relation to an american company with a similar name  overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the asian operations of the american international group  along the way  he became one of london s more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global    that he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise   there needs to be a cultural change   he said in a televised interview in march  in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay   a lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs    in turn  deal makers in london and new york  who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly  percent  are not hiding their dislike of the man  more than any other bank on wall street  credit suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses  allocating large chunks in company stock  which has halved in value  so when their new chief executive gave a speech in may and said that credit suisse s stock price  reflected reality   bankers  especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades  could not believe it  on credit suisse s newly renovated trading floor in new york  several bankers  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  grumbled that mr  thiam had  lost the building   which is wall street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders  and when he has appeared on television in recent months  employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen  according those bankers  who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly  mr  thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in new york last year  but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier  said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly  in particular  many at credit suisse find mr  thiam s personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low  this is particularly true when compared with brady w  dougan  his   predecessor  mr  thiam s own dealings with the media are handled by a british firm  powerscourt  he enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in london and davos  switzerland  and he recently purchased a luxury home in herrliberg  an exclusive lakeside enclave in zurich  to be sure  analysts agree that credit suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like deutsche bank as a profit center  instead  mr  thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firm s private bankers in asia  by providing loans to   magnates in indonesia or helping billionaire clients in china with initial public offerings  mr  thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies  he has been to china and broader asia at least four times in his new capacity  and his business cards carry a mandarin translation on the back  mr  thiam s defenders say that with the future of credit suisse in doubt  he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from   traders and bankers should not deter him  and it is also true that wealth managers in switzerland and asia  where mr  thiam is adding resources  are embracing the new strategy  following last year s losses  he also asked his board for a  percent cut in his bonus  taking in     million for the six months he worked last year  to date  the credit suisse board appears to be standing with mr  thiam  indeed  having had two wall street chiefs since   the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like mr  thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it  nevertheless  directors were not happy with his televised comments in march when mr  thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him  mr  thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached  though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment  mr  thiam also called these   traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a  clarification  of his remarks   the board is  percent behind the strategy  tidjane and the executive board   said richard e  thornburgh  a former credit suisse banker with  years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the board s risk committee  with morale in new york at a low point  mr  thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders  hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients  for many  though  this is easier said than done  it is unusual  after all  for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firm s revenue  that is particularly true on wall street  where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm  as productive bankers head for the exits in droves  over the last six months  at least  bankers and traders have left the firm  with many of these coming from credit suisse s once prestigious technology unit in san francisco  the culture clash at credit suisse recalls a similar dispute at morgan stanley a decade ago  like mr  thiam  philip j  purcell was a former whiz kid consultant from mckinsey who preferred slow and steady brokers over bankers with big egos and even bigger paychecks  a   uprising forced mr  purcell s departure  since power on wall street was then still in the hands of deal makers and traders  with wealth managers now ascendant  mr  thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed   is there a vision  is there a direction   mr  thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy   the germans say

       "      <td>palm beach  fla   reuters    president donald trump pressed chinese president xi jinping to do more to curb north korea s nuclear program and help reduce the gaping u s  trade deficit with beijing in talks on friday  even as he toned down the strident anti china rhetoric of his election campaign  trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first u s  china summit   as did several of his top aides   but they provided few concrete specifics other than china s agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation  as the two leaders wrapped up a florida summit overshadowed by u s  missile strikes in syria overnight  xi joined trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the world s two biggest economies  trump s aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about china s trade practices and said there was some headway  with xi agreeing to a  day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting u s  exports and reducing china s trade surplus with the united states  speaking after the two day summit at trump s mar a lago resort in florida  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson also said that xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in north korea s missile and nuclear programs   though he did not offer any new formula for cracking pyongyang s defiant attitude   trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of american jobs by china  many blue collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on nov   and trump is under pressure to deliver for them  the republican president tweeted last week that the united states could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with xi  will be a very difficult one    on friday  the unpredictable trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader   we have made tremendous progress in our relationship with china   trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large u s  and chinese flags   we will be making additional progress  the relationship developed by president xi and myself i think is outstanding   and i believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away   he added  without providing details  xi also spoke in mostly positive terms   we have engaged in deeper understanding  and have built a trust   he said   i believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations     for the peace and stability of the world  we will also fulfill our historical responsibility    well  i agree with you  percent   trump replied  china s official xinhua news agency said xi had encouraged the united states to take part in the  one belt  one road  plan  xi s signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across asia  africa and europe  seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to asia strategy of trump s predecessor barack obama  xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said china and the united states should  make good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries  joint staffs of the armed forces   although xinhua did not give further details  chinese state media on saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of u s  china relations  but in a sign that rough spots remained  tillerson afterwards described the discussions as  very frank and candid    president trump and president xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect   he said  after the meeting  trump took xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish spanish style complex  trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to xi  who did the same  tillerson said trump had accepted xi s invitation to visit china and that they also agreed to upgrade a u s  china dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said the chinese had expressed an interest in reducing china s trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation   that s the first time i ve heard them say that in a bilateral context   he said  ross declined to say whether the united states was ready to designate china a currency manipulator  however  referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed  although trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label china a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration  he has refrained from doing so   the highly anticipated u s  china summit was upstaged by u s  missile strikes overnight against a syrian air base from which trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week  it was the first direct u s  assault on the russian backed government of syrian president bashar al assad in six years of civil war   the swift action in syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear armed north korea   and by extension  its ally china   as well as other countries like iran and russia of trump s willingness to use military force  north korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the united states  tillerson said xi agreed with trump that north korea s nuclear advances had reached a  very serious stage   he said trump also raised u s concerns about china s activities in the south china sea  beijing is building and fortifying islands in pursuit of

entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists   election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads  what is most entertaining about trump s ascendancy to the oval office is that it was totally unexpected  catching cocksure marxists at cnn and other alphabet channels completely off guard  let s go over some of the more entertaining reactions last tuesday    hillary shill martha raddatz breaks down in tears  over at abc  the wrinkled old hillary shill martha raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow clinton operative george staphylococcus  explaining why the bitch lost the election   raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal hillary clinton  she s sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next  years  her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could    bernstein plays the race card  to the mainstream media  white people voting in accordance with their own self interest is racist  in fact  white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to cnn  washington post  journalist  carl bernstein even went so far as to say trump s election is  tragic and dangerous  as despondent and quite possibly drugged cnn propagandists looked on  bernstein seemed most upset about trump s immigration policy proposals  in which mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate u s  immigration law  bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of black lives matter  la raza and other black and brown supremacist groups    chris matthews goes into hamster rationalization mode  hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women  but effeminate  low t manlets like chris matthews also have them  his first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say hillary won the debates  she didn t  then he says she had the best ad campaign  nobody believes advertising or anything you say  anymore chris  then matthews says she had the best ground game  she might have  but she was a terrible candidate  the half man  half

needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired  old leftist talking points from the  about the evil white male  especially white males that haven t been turned into geldings  he then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office  lmfao  really  dude  he then says immigrants are afraid now that trump is going to be president  no van  immigrants aren t afraid  illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say  fuck you   to u s  immigration law are afraid  as they should be  jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a so called white lash  he says trump s campaign was based on  throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others   umm  isn t that what the entire platform of the democratic party is  van  throwing away  nay  crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others   your entire career is based on just that  mr  jones    cbs does a mea culpa cbs published an article admitting how badly the press is biased cbs was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the network s shoddy coverage of the  election  this stunning article entitled  the unbearable smugness of the press  needed to be written  years ago  better late than never  cbs actually echoed what we in the manosphere and alt right have been saying since day one with the op ed piece  this is all symptomatic of modern journalism s great moral and intellectual failing  its unbearable smugness   had hillary clinton won  there d be a winking  we did it  feeling in the press  a sense that we were brave and called trump a liar and saved the republic  the eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us  so much for that  the audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate  it turned out  was rather limited  this was particularly true when it came to voters  the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it  trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him  they hate us  and have for some time  and can you blame them  journalists love mocking trump supporters  we insult their appearances  we dismiss them as racists and sexists  we emote on twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other  and yet we reject their feelings as invalid  damn  at least some people over there know why we hate them   that includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected   shameless activism got marxism  it s the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is not on the side of the average american  it hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet  the evil white male  the rebuke of a sorry candidate like hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoe in caught the smug son of a bitches off guard  their reactions are priceless  and need to be documented and remembered  these reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like return of kings and web sites like breitbart and drudge are sorely needed  indispensable resources in this day and age  we have not been getting the truth from media for generations  and now  as alternative voices appear  the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper  the once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for new world order socialism  the election night  horror show  only solidifies this point  we should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda  if nothing else to balance the scales  the media are not friends of the american public  ultimately  the tired old socialist media must be dismantled in order

new cooperation between russia and turkey  and it strengthened turkey s commitment to separating rebel groups it supports from jihadist groups  but representatives of the syrian delegations      both from the government and opposition      immediately expressed reservations  they emphasized that they had not signed on to a document that had been brokered by the main sponsors of the warring sides

start of the talks  held in astana  capital of kazakhstan  a main result of the meeting was to firm up russia s growing role in the syria diplomacy  establishing the astana talks as a part of  but not a replacement for  the geneva process that has been spearheaded for years by the united nations and the united states  the new document said meetings in astana  a capital five time zones east of

multireligious  nonsectarian and democratic state   and their conviction  that there is no military solution to the syrian conflict and that it can only be solved through a political process    those

affiliate in syria  formerly known as the nusra front  pledging to  separate  them from armed opposition groups  that could be an important provision  since the syrian government led by president bashar   tends to classify all the opposition fighters indiscriminately as terrorist groups  and many have been unable or unwilling to separate themselves from forces of the former nusra front on the battlefield  the agreement did not specify how such a separation might occur  however  in astana  government representatives said that they still considered the rebel fighters to be terrorists and were waiting to see if turkey followed through on the agreement  rebel negotiators said the meetings had given them hope that russia might be open to hearing rebel concerns and become more willing to press the syrian government for a political resolution  but such optimism did not extend to iran  which had stuck to a harder line  staffan de mistura  the special united nations envoy for syria who

vehicles had been tossed like tinkertoys and trees had been ripped from their roots  at least seven people had died  the crew knew they were in for nasty weather  but they were scallopers  weather comes with the job  as night fell on feb    the winds started to blow across new york city  at   p  m  a large section of a facade collapsed on fordham street in the bronx  at    a   was blown over on the upper level of the george washington bridge  by midnight  there were reports of downed trees and power lines around the region  off the coast  winds were gusting up to  miles an hour  according to data collected by the national weather service  the men on the carolina queen had a decision to make  one successful   scalloping trip can pull in a profit of      each fisherman can make     on a good voyage  the crew was   fishing  about  miles off the coast  as the storm approached  the men decided to steer the vessel closer to shore      past a predetermined demarcation line that would stop the clock on their allotted   yearly limit at sea  the carolina queen had only  bags of scallops       pounds per bag      on ice in the hold  with the scallop season drawing to a close  this trip was the crew s last chance for a major haul  when the skies cleared  they expected  they would get back to business  but shortly after  a  m  on feb    the vessel  battered by wind and waves  ran aground  soon  one of its generators failed and the carolina queen issued a desperate mayday  setting in motion a harrowing rescue operation  in the next few hours  a coast guard boat capsized and fire department vessels were unable to reach the stranded scallop boat because of the weather  ultimately  the coast guard decided to undertake a daring airlift operation by a crew dispatched from atlantic city   nothing about this really was routine   said deputy chief george healy of the new york fire department   this was a very treacherous operation    the airmen and women at coast guard air station

rescue swimmer in the widely mocked     movie  the guardian       and a wry acknowledgment that the coast guard is not always accorded the kind of respect reserved for other branches of the military  but the coast guard plays a vital role in protecting the nation s maritime interests  since it was absorbed into the department of homeland security  combating terrorism has been added to the sprawling mission carried out by its      reserve  civilian and auxiliary men and women serving around the world  despite the expanded responsibilities  its budget has been buffeted in his  state of the coast guard address  adm  paul f  zukunft  the coast guard commandant  said  percent of the acquisition budget had been slashed over the previous four years   i m concerned that aging platforms and crumbling infrastructure continue to hinder mission success   admiral zukunft said   today we re seeing significant increase in demand across all of our daily activities  and it limits our ability to respond to major contingencies  indeed  we are facing a time like none other in our nearly  years of service    air coast guard station atlantic city  at the william j  hughes federal aviation administration technical center at the atlantic city international airport  is the closest air station to new york city  it was formed in  when coast guard air station brooklyn and group air station cape may  new jersey  were merged  the squadron comprises    dolphin helicopters  its crews are responsible for covering hundreds of miles of coastline in connecticut  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland and virginia      as well as interior bays and rivers such as chesapeake bay  the delaware and hudson rivers and long island sound  two helicopters are always ready to be airborne within  minutes  lt  mark bruno    was the aircraft commander on duty on feb   when the call came in that a fishing vessel off the coast of the rockaways was in trouble  at   a  m  his team was dispatched to new york city  the dolphin helicopter can fly faster than  m  p  h  but it would still take about  minutes to reach the carolina queen  the helicopter crew members      including lt  j  g  maggie champlin    the   petty officer second class kensuke caldwell    the flight mechanic and petty officer third class joe     the rescue swimmer      took off in darkness shortly before  a  m  knowing very little about what they might find   we knew it was a fishing vessel  and fishing vessels are always tricky   lieutenant bruno said  there are lines and riggings to contend with  and there often is very little room for error  especially when trying to pluck someone off the deck  and it can be more complicated when the vessel is no longer afloat   normally  when a boat is on the waves  it has a certain rhythm   lieutenant bruno said  that is not the case when it has run aground  as the crew sped north  it was in communication with the fire department  which arrived on the scene shortly before  a  m  it was soon clear that this would not be a straightforward operation  the first distress signal to the outside world from the carolina queen was an emergency flare that lit up the sky shortly after   a  m  aaron bell    a ups worker who lives in an apartment near the water on beach  place in queens  said it was so windy and foggy  you couldn t even see the ocean  from the shore  but someone spotted the flare  chief healy said the first  call came in at   a  m  emergency responders were on the scene at    chief healy has  years on the job  he has seen all sorts of disasters and is not one for overstatement  the ship was not more than  yards from shore  but once contact was made with those on board  it was clear that the ship and its crew were in dire trouble   we directed the captain and crew to put on exposure suits   chief healy said   we had a fear that the boat was going to capsize    waves were cresting as high as  feet and breaking on the ship  the scallopers were as stranded as they might have been in the open ocean  as the fire department was responding  a   coast guard rescue boat was also racing to the scene  dispatched by coast guard station jones beach  the boat capsized in the rough waters near east rockaway inlet before it reached the carolina queen  its crew members had to save themselves  swimming to shore  the team aboard the helicopter learned of that accident as they made their way up the coast   you get a little nervous hearing that   lieutenant bruno said   but it was good to know they were safe    that part of the incident is still under investigation the coast guard declined to answer questions about what might have gone wrong  the fire department had rescue boats to deploy  but the seas were so severe that the f  d  n  y  decided to wait for air support  a fire department helicopter  only a short distance away at floyd bennett field  was grounded because of the heavy fog  the crew of the carolina queen would have to wait  scallop fishing may not conjure up the   of those catching crabs in the icy waters of the bering strait or the exploits of   tuna fisherman chronicled on shows like  the deadliest catch    but the most dangerous fishing grounds in america remain those off the northeast coast      more dangerous than the bering sea  according to data collected by the centers for disease control and prevention  from  to   the years covered by the agency s data   people died while fishing at sea and  of them were in the northeast  the scallop industry had the   rate of fatalities   deaths per    workers  among all workers in the united states over the same period  according to the c  d  c  there were four deaths per    workers  the size of the crew and the time at sea contribute to the dangers  drew minkiewicz  a lawyer who represents the fisheries survival fund  said that since   the number of vessels permitted to fish for scallops has been limited  and with fewer unregistered ships at sea  there have been fewer accidents  the atlantic sea scallop      placopecten magellanicus      has been popular since the   when norwegian immigrants first scoured the seas south of new bedford  mass  the supply could swing between scarcity and plenty  but in the  huge algae blooms known as brown tides appeared several years in a row and threatened to destroy the scallops  ecosystem on the east coast  even after those tides passed  the industry almost did itself in by overfishing  only after regulations were passed in the  and the industry banded together with the scientific community to improve fishing techniques did the fisheries rebound  now  scalloping along the atlantic coast from maine to north carolina is among the most lucrative fishing in the world  in   the catch was estimated to be worth more than   million  most of the ships that fish these waters are registered with the national marine fisheries service  including the carolina queen  the ship is owned by the wells scallop company  a   family operation that stretches back four generations  bill wells  who runs the company  declined to talk about the incident  through an industry spokesman  he said he wanted to thank both the coast guard and the new york city emergency responders and said that the incident had been classified as an accident  with no fault found on the part of the crew and no fines issued against his company  the industry operates under strict guidelines  many aimed at ensuring sustainability of the fisheries  to fish some areas with known scallop beds  a permit is needed  and the haul is capped    fishing  on the other hand  is restricted only by the annual     limit  the clock is always ticking   we get so few days to go out  we have to find every efficiency to maximize our days at sea   said joe gilbert  who owns empire fisheries and  as captain of a boat called the rigulus  is part of the   scalloping community  in preparation for the carolina queen s voyage  the crew would have spent days getting ready  buying     in groceries  loading more than    pounds of ice and prepping the equipment on the   vessel  the vessel steamed north from the chesapeake bay  traveling  hours to reach the coast off new jersey  where the crew would probably have started fishing  then the work would begin  it is pretty standard for a crew to work eight hours on and take four hours off  but in reality it often is more like nine hours on and three off  if you are a good sleeper  you are lucky to get two hours    before heading back on deck  the huge tows scouring the ocean bed for scallops dredge for about  minutes and are then hauled up  their catch dumped on deck before the tows are reset and plunged back into the water  a process that can be done in as little as  minutes  while the dredge did its work  the crew on duty on the carolina queen sorted through the muddy mix of rocks and sand and other flotsam on the ship s deck  looking for the wavy round shells of the scallops   the biggest danger is handling the gear on deck   mr  gilbert said   it is very heavy gear on a pitching deck  and you get a lot of injured feet  injured hands    once the scallops are sorted  according to industry regulations  they must be shucked by hand  the crew spends hours opening the shells and slicing out the abductor muscle of the mollusks      the fat  tasty morsel that winds up on plates at a restaurants like oceana in midtown manhattan  where a plate of sea scallops à la plancha costs as much as    a single boat can haul    pounds in a day  by the time the carolina queen ran aground  it was carrying only around    pounds  as the coast guard helicopter circled overhead  however  the scallops on ice below deck were not the most pressing concern  it was around   a  m   it was definitely a dangerous situation they were in   lieutenant bruno said   they had lost their generator and were taking on water  and i think that is when they made the decision that they had to come off    but how  as the helicopter approached the rockaways  the coast guard  in consultation with the fire department on shore  had come up with a plan  by then there were dozens of emergency workers on the beach  petty officer   the rescue swimmer  would be lowered into the surf to assess the situation  and if all went well  swim each stranded fisherman to shore  the fog was still thick as the helicopter made its first sweeping pass overhead  circling around a second time  the fog had cleared enough to put petty officer   into the water  petty officer   had joined the coast guard knowing he wanted to become a rescue swimmer  he had made up his mind after spending a summer working as an ocean lifeguard in kitty hawk  n  c  he completed aviation survival technician a school in december  and is now  at   a fully qualified rescue swimmer  in the course of his training  he had been part of scores of rescue drills  but he had never drilled on a ship that had run aground  as soon as he splashed down in the churning surf  it was clear that putting the fishermen into the water would not work   i swam in to shore  where the helicopter picked me up and then subsequently deployed me to the bow of the boat   he said   it was really rocking  bouncing back and forth     the ship was listing  degrees to port   he said   the crew was all dressed in their survival suits when i landed on the bow of the boat  they were very cooperative  several of them had small black garbage bags filled with personal effects that they asked if they could bring with them  they definitely seemed ready to leave    even if the rescuers had managed to rig some wires from ship to shore  which the fire department was prepared to do  the scallopers would have had to leap  to  feet into the water and then contend with waves more than  feet high   it had looked different from the air  but once i was on the ship it was clear that that plan would not work   petty officer   said  the coast guard decided to lift each of the seven stranded men from the boat using a rescue basket      a delicate operation   water was already in the hull  and the ship was moving in a way separate from the way the ocean was moving   recalled petty officer    lieutenant bruno hovered the helicopter some  feet above the vessel as petty officer   loaded the scallopers  one by one  into the basket  and one by one  they were ferried to shore  where the fire department was waiting  as morning broke  the helicopter had been airborne for more than two hours  and there were still fishermen on the ship  fuel was running dangerously low  time was running out  the seventh man      the captain      wearing jeans and a sweatshirt  was the last to leave the ship  he asked about remaining with the vessel but agreed in the end that it was best to go   his life being more valuable than a piece of equipment   petty officer   noted  as the captain was loaded into the basket  lieutenant bruno looked at his fuel gauge  he had four minutes left  with the captain safely deposited on shore and the mission complete  lieutenant bruno flew to floyd bennett field and set the helicopter down  all seven fishermen were safe and were transported to jamaica hospital medical center for observation  none was seriously injured  the ship  too  was salvaged  it is now being repaired at a shipyard in massachusetts  even the scallops on board were saved  they were sold to a dealer based in the brooklyn navy yard  petty officer   reflecting on the rescue  said it was both the easiest and the hardest he had ever taken part in   it was my first   he said</td>\n",

arthur  was a clerk at a lyons tea shop in cardiff  his mother  gladys  was a housewife  mr  belle received diplomas from the portsmouth school of architecture in england and the architectural association in london before moving to the united states in   once in america  mr  belle worked for josep lluís sert and victor gruen before starting his own firm in  with richard l  blinder and john h  beyer  mr  blinder died in   mr  beyer is still active  mr  belle s early work included community planning projects in manhattan  with the addition of james marston fitch to the practice in   beyer blinder belle began moving to the forefront of   architecture  the firm attracted wide attention in  with its renovation and restoration of the abandoned ellis island immigration station into the ellis island national museum of immigration  the vaulted ceiling in the former registry room  made of    guastavino tiles  was cleaned until it looked      as mr  belle aptly put it      like     where modern interventions were needed  they were made as inconspicuous and respectful as possible  when the haupt conservatory at the botanical garden in the bronx was restored in   herbert muschamp  who was then the architecture critic at the new york times  said it could  once again hold its sparkling glass head up high amid the great architectural symbols of new york    though critics have faulted beyer blinder belle s conservatism  it is worth recalling that the firm was associated in  with the daring architect santiago calatrava in what proved to be a losing bid to redesign the james a  farley building  also known as the general post office  as a pennsylvania station annex  penn station was not where mr  belle was to win his greatest renown  that was at grand central  you almost had to have been there in the  and   to believe how far the   terminal had fallen into decrepitude  even after its status as a landmark was upheld by the united states supreme court in   travelers shared grand central with a large homeless population   the building was divided into turf claimed by different drug dealers   mr  belle and maxinne r  leighton wrote in  grand central  gateway to a million lives     commuters were scared to take trains there at night  parents warned their children not to use the dangerous bathrooms    in   a design and engineering consortium led by beyer blinder belle began work  their strategic first strike was to demolish a billboard called the kodak colorama  which had blocked daylight into the main concourse for  years   it was as if life were being breathed back into the building   mr  belle and ms  leighton wrote   many commuters stopped in their tracks  speechless and amazed at the change that had so instantly brought back the majesty of the space    their astonishment increased as the concourse ceiling was cleaned by workers on a scaffold that was rolled slowly through the room over a   period  the mud brown sky turned a startling teal  with stars  constellations and zodiac signs popping out in   contrast  besides restoring the past  beyer blinder belle made fundamental changes  too  starting with the construction of an entirely new marble staircase to the east balcony  it echoed  but did not replicate  the ornate western staircase  some preservationists hated the idea  but the firm prevailed before city and state preservation agencies after it uncovered a plan by the original architects  warren  wetmore  that showed a staircase to the east balcony  that proved  mr  belle and ms  leighton wrote  that the idea  was not an   ploy to have our personal imprint on the building  but that in fact our goal was to complete the original design    mr  muschamp  the architecture critic  approved   the new eastern staircase  which threatened to diminish the room s amplitude  has the opposite effect of magnifying it   he wrote in   as the   million renovation neared completion  he continued   even more impressive is the uncovering of the ramps  located just behind the ticket windows  that lead down to the lower level and its fabled oyster bar     beyer blinder belle s greatest accomplishment   mr  muschamp said   has been to reveal that grand central is above all a monument to movement    mr  belle s first wife  wendy adams belle  an artist and teacher  died in   his second wife  anne belle  a documentary filmmaker  died in   he died on thursday in remsenburg  n  y  where he had a home  he also lived in manhattan  the cause was lewy body disease  said his son david belle  who survives him  along with another son  sebastian three daughters  amelia  fenella and antonia chapman and eight grandchildren  mr  belle knew his work would never fully be done   the act of restoring a building to its original state is only half the battle   he and ms  leighton wrote   the other half is to guard against its denigration throughout its future existence</td>\n",

provided to breitbart texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  hannibal   he has already received death threats as a result of interrupting   conference calls an unidentified black man said  when those mother f  kers are by themselves  that s when when we should start f   ing them up  like they do us  when a bunch of them ni  ers takin  one of us out  that s how we should roll up   he said   cause we already roll up in gangs anyway  there should be six or seven black mother f  ckers  see that white person  and then lynch their ass  let s turn the tables  they conspired that if  cops started losing people   then  there will be a state of emergency  he speculated that one of two things would happen   a big ass  war   or  ni  ers  they are going to start backin  up  we are already getting killed out here so what the f  k we got to lose  sunshine could be heard saying   yep  that s true  that s so f  king true  he said   we need to turn the tables on them  our kids are getting shot out here  somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side he said   everybody ain t down for that s  t  or whatever  but like i say  everybody has a different position of war   he continued   because they don t give a f  k anyway   he said again   we might as well utilized them for that s  t and turn the tables on these n  ers  he said  that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties  and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours  they are out their killing black people  black lives don t matter  that s what those mother f  kers   so we got to make it matter to them  find a mother f  ker that is alone  snap his ass  and then f   in hang him from a damn tree  take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f  kers  we  just need one example   and  then people will start watchin    this will turn the tables on s  t  he said  he said this will start  a trickle down effect   he said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat hanging   that will start the  trickle down effect   he continued   black people are good at starting trends  he said that was how  to get the upper hand  another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us  the first black male said   that will be the best method right there  breitbart texas previously reported how sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls  she subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators  the veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls one of the  f   yoflag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call   we are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife  and your f   ing piece of sh t unborn creature will be hung from a tree  breitbart texas previously encountered sunshine at a sandra bland protest at the waller county jail in texas  where she said all white people should be killed  she told journalists and photographers   you see this nappy ass hair on my head    that means i am one of those more militant negroes   she said she was at the protest because  these

                                                                                                                      a dozen politically active pastors came here for a private dinner friday night to hear a conversion story unique in the context of presidential politics  how louisiana gov  bobby jindal traveled from hinduism to protestant christianity and  ultimately  became what he calls an  evangelical catholic    over two hours  jindal    recalled talking with a girl in high school who wanted to  save my soul   reading the bible in a closet so his parents would not see him and feeling a stir while watching a movie during his senior year that depicted jesus on the cross    i was struck  and struck hard   jindal told the pastors   this was the son of god  and he had died for our sins    jindal s session with the christian clergy  who lead congregations in the early presidential battleground states of iowa and south carolina  was part of a behind the scenes effort by the louisiana governor to find a political base that could help propel him into the top tier of republican candidates seeking to run for the white house in    known in gop circles mostly for his mastery of policy issues such as health care  jindal  a rhodes scholar and graduate of the ivy league s brown university  does not have an obvious pool of activist supporters to help drive excitement outside his home state  so he is harnessing his religious experience in a way that has begun to appeal to parts of the gop s influential core of religious conservatives  many of whom have yet to find a favorite among the republicans eyeing the presidential race   other potential  gop candidates are wooing the evangelical base  including sens  rand paul  ky   and ted cruz  tex   and indiana gov  mike pence   but over the weekend in lynchburg   a mecca of sorts for evangelicals as the home of liberty university  founded in the  by the rev  jerry falwell   jindal appeared to make progress   in addition to his dinner with the pastors  he delivered a well received  call to action  address to   christian conservatives gathered for liberty s commencement ceremony  talking again about his faith while assailing what he said was president obama s record of attacking religious liberty   the pastors who came to meet jindal said his intimate descriptions of his experiences stood out    he has the convictions  and he has what it takes to communicate them   said brad sherman of solid rock christian church in coralville  iowa  sherman helped former arkansas governor mike huckabee in his winning  campaign for delegates in iowa   another huckabee admirer  the rev  c  mitchell brooks of second baptist church in belton  s c   said jindal s commitment to christian values and his compelling story put him  on a par  with huckabee  who was a baptist preacher before entering politics   the visiting pastors flew to lynchburg over the weekend at the invitation of the american renewal project  a well funded nonprofit group that encourages evangelical christians to engage in the civic arena with voter guides  get out the vote drives and programs to train pastors in grass roots activism  the group s founder  david lane  has built a pastor network in politically important states such as iowa  missouri  ohio and south carolina and has led trips to israel with paul and others seeking to make inroads with evangelical activists   the group that lane invited to lynchburg included donald wild mon  a retired minister and founder of the american family association  a prominent evangelical activist group that has influence through its network of more than  christian radio stations   most of the pastors that lane s organization brought to lynchburg had not met jindal  but they said he captured their interest recently when he stepped forward to defend phil robertson  patriarch of the  duck dynasty  television show family  amid a controversy over disparaging remarks he made about gays in an interview with gq magazine   throughout his lynchburg visit  jindal presented himself as a willing culture warrior   during his commencement address saturday  he took up the cause of twin brothers whose hgtv reality series about renovating and reselling houses   flip it forward   was canceled last week after a web site revealed that they had protested against same sex marriage at the  democratic national convention in charlotte   the siblings  jason and david benham  both liberty graduates  attended the graduation and a private lunch with jindal  who called the action against them  another demonstration of intolerance from the entertainment industry     if these guys had protested at the republican party convention  instead of canceling their show  hgtv would probably have given them a raise   jindal said as the liberty crowd applauded   he cited the hobby lobby craft store chain  which faced a legal challenge after refusing to provide employees with insurance coverage for contraceptives as required under the affordable care act  members of the family that owns hobby lobby  who have become heroes to many religious conservatives  have said that they are morally opposed to the use of certain types of birth control and that they considered the requirement a violation of their first amendment right to religious freedom   the family was  committed to honor the lord by being generous employers  paying well above minimum wage and increasing salaries four years in a row even in the midst of the enduring recession   jindal told the liberty graduates   none of this matters to the obama administration    but for the pastors who came to see jindal in action  the governor s own story was the highlight of the weekend  and in many ways  he was unlike any other aspiring president these activists had met   piyush jindal was born in   four months after his parents arrived in baton rouge  la   from their native india  he changed his name to bobby as a young boy  adopting the name of a character on a favorite television show   the brady bunch    his decision to become a christian  he told the pastors  did not come in one moment of lightning epiphany  instead  he said  it happened in phases  growing from small seeds planted over time   jindal recalled that his closest friend from grade school gave him a bible with his name emblazoned in gold on the cover as a christmas present  it struck him initially as an unimpressive gift  jindal told the pastors    who in the world would spend good money for a bible when everyone knows you can get one free in any hotel   he recalled thinking at the time   and the gold lettering meant i couldn t give it away or return it    his religious education reached a higher plane during his junior year in high school  he told his dinner audience  he wanted to ask a pretty girl on a date during a hallway conversation  and she started talking about her faith in god and her opposition to abortion  the girl invited him to visit her church   jindal said he was skeptical and set out to  investigate all these fanciful claims  made by the girl and other friends  he started reading the bible in his closet at home   i was unsure how my parents would react   he said   after the stirring moment when he saw christ depicted on the cross during the religious movie  the bible and his very existence suddenly seemed clearer to him  jindal told the pastors   jindal did not dwell on his subsequent conversion to catholicism just a few years later in college  where he said he immersed himself in the traditions of the church   he touched on it briefly during the commencement address  noting in passing that  i am best described as an evangelical catholic   mostly  he sought to showcase the ways in which he shares values with other christian conservatives    i read the words of jesus christ  and i realized that they were true   jindal told the graduates saturday  offering a less detailed accounting of his conversion than he had done the night before with the pastors   i used to think that i had found god  but i believe it is more accurate to say that he found me     \n",

                     the owner of the ringling bar  located south of white sulphur springs  is standing behind his facebook post that criticizes nfl players who take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality  the post was made on the ringling bar s facebook page tuesday night and has since received hundreds of comments and shares  the post reads   the ringling bar will no longer show any nfl games  this will allow us to air the pbr  rodeo and nascar events whose competitors are true americans  sorry for any inconvenience  ringling bar co owner kurt bekemans  who grew up in the paradise valley  published the post and said he doesn t care if the post turns some customers away  seriously  i would not care if non americans didn t patronize the place   said bekemans   i d like to speak for rural america  i bet you wouldn t see any farmers or ranchers in our whole country take a knee such as these guys do  i bet you couldn t find one  they appreciate what our great nation has given them and i think that s the least you could do to give thanks to our country is stand for the flag and the anthem  as of wednesday morning  a majority of the comments were in support of the bar  we all love ya for this  i ll be by with as many people i can round up    said one commenter another person was critical  writing   ha ha of course nascar is not protesting the treatment of minority s because they don t care about them    read more  krtv   \n",

leak was reported monday morning  enterprise products partners said monday it had shut its seaway crude pipeline  a   barrel per day conduit that transports crude oil from cushing  oklahoma to gulf coast refineries  the leak occurred sunday night in an industrial area of cushing  the company did not provide an estimate of the volume spilled  but said there was no danger to the public   seaway personnel continue to make progress in cleaning up the spill  substantially all of which has been contained in a retention pond at enbridge s facility   the company said in a news release  pdf   explaining that the pipeline is a    joint venture  between enterprise and enbridge inc   vacuum trucks are being used to recover the crude oil and return it to storage tanks on site    the impacted segment of the legacy pipeline has a capacity of   barrels   the release added   however the actual amount of crude oil released will be significantly less and won t be determined until recovery efforts are complete   the incident comes after another pipeline rupture in pennsylvania early on friday  where   gallons of gasoline poured into the susquehanna river  and about one month after a major gasoline pipeline run by colonial pipeline co  had to halt pumping for a couple of weeks due to a spill in alabama   meanwhile  upi reports that  he release from the seaway pipeline is the second associated with the cushing storage hub in less than a month  plains all american pipeline reported problems with infrastructure from colorado city  to cushing earlier this month

pipeline  dapl  have been saying for months that the project threatens their right to safe drinking water   oil pipelines break  spill  and leak it s not a question of if  it s a question of where and when    year old anna lee rain yellowhammer  a member of the standing rock sioux tribe  wrote in a recent appeal   with such a high chance that this pipeline will leak   she wrote of the enbridge backed dapl    i can only guess that the oil industry keeps pushing for it because it doesn t care about our health and safety  the industry seems to think our lives are more expendable than others

minister theresa may s offer of  settled status  for eu residents is flawed and will leave them with fewer rights after brexit  the european parliament s brexit coordinator said on tuesday  a family of five could face a bill of  pounds to acquire the new status  guy verhofstadt told may s brexit secretary david davis in a letter seen by reuters    a very significant amount for a family on low income   listing three other concerns for the eu legislature  which must approve any treaty on the march  exit  verhofstadt told davis   under your proposals  eu citizens will definitely notice a deterioration of their status as a result of brexit  and the parliament s aim all along has been that eu citizens  and uk citizens in the eu   should notice no difference   verhofstadt  a former belgian prime minister  wrote in response to davis  who had written to him after parliament complained last week that there remained  major issues  to be settled on the rights of the  million eu citizens in britain  on tuesday  he told reporters that parliament was determined that expatriates should not become  victims of brexit   may had unveiled more details last week of a system aimed at giving people already in britain a quick and cheap way of asserting their rights to stay there indefinitely  the issue  along with how much britain owes and the new eu uk border across ireland  is one on which the eu wants an outline agreement before opening talks on the future of trade  verhofstadt said lawmakers were not dismissing british efforts to streamline applications but saw flaws in the nature of  settled status  itself  as well as the cost  which is similar to that of acquiring a british passport  he cited three others    europeans should simply  declare  a whole household resident  without needing an  application  process  the burden of proof should be on the british authorities to deny them rights    more stringent conditions on criminal records could mean some eu residents  including some now with permanent resident status  being deported for failing to gain  settled status     eu residents would lose some rights to bring relatives to britain as the new status would give them the same rights as british people  who now have fewer rights than eu citizens       \n",

                                      washington  reuters    charles schumer  the top democrat in the u s  senate  called on president donald trump on sunday to name a single official to oversee and coordinate relief efforts in hurricane ravaged puerto rico  schumer  along with representatives nydia velàzquez and jose serrano  said a  ceo of response and recovery  is needed to manage the complex and ongoing federal response in the territory  where millions of americans remain without power and supplies  in a statement  schumer said the current federal response to hurricane maria s impact on the island had been  disorganized  slow footed and mismanaged    this person will have the ability to bring all the federal agencies together  cut red tape on the public and private side  help turn the lights back on  get clean water flowing and help bring about recovery for millions of americans who have gone too long in some of the worst conditions   he said  the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment  the democrats contended that naming a lone individual to manage the government s relief efforts was critical  particularly given that the federal emergency management agency is already stretched thin from dealing with other crises  such as the aftermath of hurricane harvey in texas and the wildfires in california  the severity of the puerto rico crisis  where a million people do not have clean water and millions are without power nearly a month after hurricane maria made landfall  demand a single person to focus exclusively on relief and recovery  the democrats said  forty nine people have died in puerto rico officially  with dozens more missing  the hurricane did extensive damage to the island s power grid  destroying homes  roads and other vital infrastructure  now  the bankrupt territory is struggling to provide basic services like running water  and pay its bills   it s tragically clear this administration was caught flat footed when maria hit puerto rico   said velàzquez   appointing a ceo of response and recovery will  at last  put one person with authority in charge to manage the response and ensure we are finally getting the people of puerto rico the aid they need   on thursday  trump said the federal response has been a    on a scale of one to  at a meeting with puerto rico governor ricardo rossello   the governor has asked the white house and congress for at least    billion in block grants and other types of funding  senator marco rubio called on congress to modify an    billion aid package for areas damaged by a recent swath of hurricanes to ensure that puerto rico can quickly access the funds     \n",

                             as more and more sports fans turn off espn to protest the network s   social and political agenda  parent company disney s decision to extend current ceo bob iger s contract through  means the  world s leader in sports entertainment  will continue on its merry way of alienating a large segment of americans   breitbart reported in november that espn lost    million subscribers in just over a year  moreover  for the last few years the sports network has lost    subscribers a month  in october alone  the beleaguered network lost    subscribers    the decision to keep iger instead of moving in another direction  such as promoting coo thomas staggs to the spot  has a number of substantial business implications for espn  awful announcing reports  from the outside  at least  it seems like iger is quite satisfied with espn s leadership and with the network s path on most fronts  specifically  he s regularly spoken about how important it is for espn to be in  skinny bundles   including streaming options from sling  directv and more  and about espn s forthcoming    offering  those views wouldn t necessarily be shared by a different ceo staggs  for example  spoke much more about the importance of the traditional   bundle  so a disney ceo with his views might focus more on that side  or conversely  another disney ceo might want espn to quickly go into    in a larger way  standalone access to all espn content  including tv channels  rather than starting with the   light approach iger seems to be promoting  putting those circumstances aside  the crux of espn continuing on in its political and social agenda derives from the fact that iger is a strident lifelong democrat  one so committed  in fact  that the disney stalwart   a hillary clinton fundraiser last summer along with   supporters such as entertainment mogul haim saban  chernin group chairman and ceo peter chernin  and entertainment and sports executive casey wasserman   to get an idea of iger s taste on social issues  one of his proposed  entertainment  ideas is a filmic version of girls  a popular television show starring lena dunham  somewhat surprisingly  and to the chagrin of many of his supporters and shareholders  iger is serving on president donald trump s strategic and policy forum council of ceos  iger agrees with trump on shutting down certain tax loopholes and strongly supports lowering corporate tax rates  no surprise there    earlier this month  iger reportedly defended his participation in trump s mastermind group  asserting   i think there is an opportunity for me to express views that i think         are of value to the company and its shareholders    insisting that he won t be   iger informs that he will be  adversarial to the view of the administration   which includes  immigration    yet  the ceo argues that claims asserting espn is politically slanted are  just a complete exaggeration    with that said  it looks like espn s cable subscription downward spiral will persist as long as iger remains as disney s top executive     \n",

it bit them in the a   published what appears to be a reluctant piece on president trump s outstanding accomplishments during his first  months in office  most of the people reading this piece by the atlantic are fans of their writing because they ve bought into the progressive  anti american sentiment they were fed like crack cocaine in college  almost like the patch that smokers wear to help them get through the withdrawal of nicotine while going through a cessation program  the atlantic provides their readers with enough anti trump propaganda to keep them in business  while acting like a support group for their readers  who fear every anti american piece of legislation barack obama worked so hard to implement  is all unraveling  thanks to this guy who  foolishly  wants  make america great again   of course  in the eyes of the atlantic reader  america was never great to begin with the parts where the atlantic talks about president trump s accomplishments are italicized and the comments the writer makes to counter trump s successes have been highlighted the atlantic starts out the article by giving credit to trump s  shadow government   as somehow being responsible for his amazing successes in his first  months  according to the atlantic  the  actual government  is the fake news stories and the obsession with negative chatter surrounding trump s presidency  while president trump s accomplishments have been hidden in the  shadows  the atlantic  imagine  if you will  that there is a shadow government the actual government  the administration of donald trump  is coming off the worst week of his presidency  although there haven t been any smooth weeks  trump s top legislative priority  repealing and replacing the affordable care act  seems dead for the moment   tax reform  forget it   his administration has set a new standard for chaos and dysfunction  rolling through staffers the way other administrations run through  well  legislative initiatives  trump s foreign policy remains inchoate and ineffective  meanwhile  a special counsel investigation looms over the entire administration  threatening both its legitimacy and legal jeopardy for some of its members things are going considerably better for the shadow government  with the trump administration s chaos sucking up all the attention  it s been able to move forward on a range of its priorities  which tend to be more focused on regulatory matters anyway  it is remaking the justice system  rewriting environmental rules  overhauling public lands administration  and greenlighting major infrastructure projects  it is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come  let s consider the trump administration s accomplishments  spoiler alert  like climate change  they re real one of the two biggest victories has come on border security  which was one of trump s top campaign priorities  border crossings have already plummeted  suggesting that rhetoric making it clear to immigrants that they are not welcome is effective in its own right  customs and border protections report that apprehensions of unauthorized people are down nearly  percent from the same time in    trump continues to radically exaggerate these figures  though   this decline has occurred despite trump being foiled on his actual policy proposals at the border  construction hasn t begun on his border wall yet  and federal courts have repeatedly smacked down his muslim travel ban that said  he did get one good result in courts and that points to a second area of success  the supreme court allowed parts of the travel ban to go forward  in a victory that would not have happened without neil gorsuch on the court  filling a seat that under all previous customs would have been filled by barack obama s appointee merrick garland  given his legislative struggles  the most enduring trump victories are likely to come in the judicial branch trump may get to appoint several more justices to the high court  and in the meantime  he s filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees  as the veteran democratic official ron klain wrote recently   a massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary  for while president trump is incompetent at countless aspects of his job  he is proving wildly successful in one respect  naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record setting numbers  there are the quiet  far reaching changes  getting back to pruitt  the environment is one of the places where the trump administration has had its largest impact  the most prominent move was trump s june  announcement that the u s  will withdraw from the paris climate accord  but the epa is moving on other fronts as well  it s working to dismantle barack obama s clean power plan  a signature policy aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions  in june  following a february executive order from trump  the epa began the process of rescinding the  waters of the united states rule  which aimed at protecting smaller bodies of water and streams in the same way that larger ones had been  in december  in the closing weeks of his administration  obama banned drilling in the arctic and parts of the atlantic ocean  the trump administration promptly set about undoing that ban   how interested oil companies will be remains to be seen  the new york times found in june that pruitt s epa  has moved to undo  delay or otherwise block more than  environmental rules  a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency s  year history   and it might have done more if not for constraints imposed by judges  epa tried to abandon an obama era rule on methane emissions  but a court on monday forced it to continue enforcing the rule other agencies are also in on the environmental deregulation act  the state department reversed an obama era decision  clearing the way for the keystone xl pipeline to begin construction  the interior department is considering reversing a rule on fracking on public lands  and might also reverse some equipment regulations on offshore drilling equipment implemented after the  gulf oil spill  the department has rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands although the justice department had staunchly opposed a texas voting law that has repeatedly been smacked down by courts as discriminatory  sessions switched the department s position  and it has now told courts the law ought to be allowed to remain  the attorney general has also sought to cut off funding to so called sanctuary cities  though his legal authority to do so is disputed curiously  since he campaigned as an atypically lgbt friendly republican  trump has also made a range of changes on gay issues  last week alone  the justice department announced that sexual orientation was not covered by section vii  and the president said that transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the military  the administration has also rejected obama era protections for transgender students     \n",

secretary of state to seek sworn testimony from officials  saying there was  evidence of government wrong doing and bad faith   the language in judge royce lamberth s order undercut the democratic presidential contender s assertion she was allowed to set up a private email server in her home for her work as the country s top diplomat and that the arrangement was not particularly unusual  he described clinton s email arrangement as  extraordinary  in his order filed on tuesday in federal district court in washington  referring to the state department  clinton and clinton s aides  he said there had been  constantly shifting admissions by the government and the former government officials   spokesmen for clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment   the case is a civil matter  but the order adds to the legal uncertainty that has overshadowed clinton s campaign to be the democratic nominee in the nov   presidential election  the fbi is also conducting a criminal inquiry into the arrangement after it emerged that classified government secrets ended up in clinton s unsecured email account  clinton has said she does not think she will be charged with a crime   lamberth s order granted the request by judicial watch  a conservative watchdog group suing the department under open records laws  to gather evidence  including sworn testimony  the group has filed several lawsuits  including one seeking records about the  attack in benghazi  libya  that killed u s  ambassador christopher stevens and three other americans   where there is evidence of government wrong doing and bad faith  as here  limited discovery is appropriate  even though it is exceedingly rare in foia  freedom of information  cases   lamberth noted in his order  the government is normally given the benefit of the doubt that it properly searched and produced records   since the email arrangement came to public knowledge a year ago  the state department has found itself defending clinton in scores of lawsuits from groups  individuals and news outlets who say they were wrongly denied access to clinton s federal records  clinton left the department in   but did not return her email records to the government until nearly two years later   last month  judge emmet sullivan  who is overseeing a separate judicial watch lawsuit over other clinton related records  allowed a similar motion for discovery   story refiles to fix date of presidential election  paragraph       \n",

expecting some quality tunes    i m particularly looking forward to beethoven s ninth   beamed horse supporter and piano enthusiast  jay cooper    a horse has never been given a piano before because  frankly  the establishment wouldn t allow it    now  at last  change has come  and america will change for the better    there are a lot of doubters out there  and those doubters will soon be silenced by the graceful notes of chopin  mozart and maybe even little richard    horse  dobbin williams  said   i m not really sure what s expected of me here    i m a horse  i am absolutely not qualified to play a piano    i mean  look at these hooves and the way i am in general  i can t even sit on the chair properly    why on earth did anyone think this was a good idea    cooper grinned   we did it  we ve made pianos great again    democrat  elizabeth king  said  we wanted to get a pianist of low to medium standard for the piano    she wouldn t have thumped out anything exciting  but it would have been perfectly reasonable background music    but the people have spoken  and the people wanted a horse    god bless america   get the best newsthump stories in your mailbox every friday  for free

coin   november     an investor in dave s fund emailed him asking which way colorado would vote tomorrow  he replied   depends on who counts the votes  i don t believe this is a fair election  i think the clinton crime machine  with the help of george soros and a few others  have everything under their control now    after taking the better part of a year to sift through   emails in analyzing hillary clinton s behavior with regard to conducting classified government business on her private server   which apparently was accessible to hackers and  surreptitiously  by anthony wieners porn laptop   jim comey determined in  days that   emails downloaded from hillary s private server were not relevant   sorry jim  that s impossible to believe  one highly plausible is that operatives in the deep state shut down the fbi investigation in order to preserve the treasure trove of material that will give it power over clinton s presidency  the sot was perplexed by this  so we asked john titus his take on this  his answer was quite compelling   here s what i m reasonably sure of  based on experience     jim comey looked sick when  at the conclusion of round one  and having proven beyond all doubt that hillary violateed  u s c  f   he said no reasonable prosecutor would charge her  he wasn t acting  bad acting comes right through camera lens  and that man looked like he was about to vomit when he left that dais     it took the fbi a year to conclude round one of its investigation  which was based on its review of   emails     comey had promised to get back to congress should more info arise  and when   unexpected emails showed up  he made good on his word by letting congress know  and    the fbi terminated its investigation long before reviewing   emails  i once reviewed   documents on a case  based on the foregoing  someone got to comey somewhere along the line  for all i know  though  the whole thing was scripted from start to finish  and comey read his script at every point along the way  even when it physically disgusted him in round one  so while you might be right about the time  i think if the deep state made a move on comey  it happened awhile ago  that s wholly speculative on my part  you could well be right that they got to him just recently  i just doubt it  i think he s the company man because he s a company man  for damn sure you re right about holding hillary hostage  but she s so evil it s like throwing a pedophile into a daycare center with no supervision  the shades drawn and the doors locked   with that as the preface  today

propaganda minister sean spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable asked why the white house refuses to provide documents related to former national security advisor and registered foreign agent michael flynn s hiring  spicer took the tried and true route of blaming president obama spicer explained that the trump white house isn t responsible for anything related to flynn s hiring because the documents were filled out   during the obama administration  and  those are not documents that the white house would ever possess  everything that the white house has been asked to do  the only documents that were made available to  that they asked for were the ones that the department of defense had   spicer said  explaining that he doesn t feel that the white house has an obligation to provide the information congress has requested  how about these calls made where  was working during the transition on behalf of a future president trump   cbs s major garrett asked   aren t those things that you should have some responsibility or obligation to provide if you can  it s a question  if you can   spicer said   to ask for every call a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish  those calls were made on behalf of the trump transition were they not   garrett asked  spicer  of course  told him that trump isn t responsible for anything that happened before january  even if it was done by a member of the trump transition team  when   spicer asked   we started this administration on jan    all the information that they re talking about occurred prior to him being at the white house  working for the transition   garrett pressed  not at the white house   spicer snapped   everything that is being questioned occurred prior to jan    trump and his white house are absolutely responsible for flynn   which is not good  as even hillary clinton witch hunter  congressman jason chaffetz  admits that flynn likely committed crimes watch this all happen below featured image via screengrab   \n",

slinging in advance of the us presidential vote in november  very little focus is given on the actual record and policies of hillary clinton as secretary of state with this week s damning revelations regarding gulf arab monarchs buying access into the us state dept via the clinton foundation  a clearer picture is now emerging about how the sponsorship of religious extremism  as well as geopolitical instability in the middle east and beyond   links directly back to the clinton global network of international oligarchs  watch this week s abc news segment  based on this line of inquiry  what will four years of a clinton presidency bring in terms of us foreign policy  a few answers to this question from global research  andre vltchek global researchif the west in general and the united states in particular  left the arab and muslim world alone and in peace  we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks  which are rocking the world from indonesia to france  there would be no mujahedeen and its mutation into al qaeda  in afghanistan or elsewhere  there would be no traces of the isis  or isil or i s  or daesh or however you choose to call it   in syria  iraq  libya or anywhere else and the super conservative wahhabi islam  that outdated  freak saudi mutant  would remain in the religious schools of the ultra regressive kingdom  instead of gaining ground all over southeast asia  the middle east and africa secular islambut the west embarked on a brutal  machiavellian path  it decided to destroy socialist islam   that  historically  moderate  compassionate and progressive religion  it smashed once secular egypt  it overthrew the government in socialist iran and then in near communist indonesia  implanting in all these places horrifically degenerate and fully outdated religious concepts  it used extremists to destroy healthy patriotism and socialism  like the brits in the  century   you can control people s brains  while we will control your natural resources    the west embraced wahhabi teaching  because it was able to guarantee full obedience  dictatorial  pro western  governance and oppressive feudalism islam has been used and abused  manipulated and virtually stripped of its essence  the process has gone so far that two leading iranian scholars  during my visit last year to tehran  declared to me   in so many parts of the world  the west created an absolutely new religion  we don t recognize it  anymore  it has nothing to do with islam  if the west in general and the united states in particular  left the arab and muslim world alone and in peace  we would most likely never see all those terrorist attacks  which are rocking the world from indonesia to france correct  like a naughty  spoiled and heartless child  the west  after destroying the soviet union  painstakingly constructed its new enemy    militant islam    so it could continue indulging in its favorite activity  which is perpetual conflict  endless wars and plunder it is as simple as that the greatest oppressors of the muslim people  those in saudi arabia  bahrain  and indonesia have all been closely allied to the west  the most terrible terrorist  muslim  organizations  from al qaida to isis  have been created  armed and supported by the west and its cronies in europe and in the united states  the  fear of terrorists  is fully exploited by the western regime   a global class alliance of plutocrats  in actuality  with headquarters in washington  where the main military and media muscle reside  it still clings to power mainly thanks to such fear implanted in the brains of  ordinary people  and what about the  war on terror   yes  there really is such war  but the west is not the one who fights it  as this goes to print  the war against terrorism is being fought by russia  iran  china  syria  hezbollah and their allies the west is still closely collaborating with the terrorists  it miraculously  avoids targeting them  when  fighting wars against them   it financially supports some and trains others  it criticizes and antagonizes those who are actually fighting the extremist militant groups extremists have been unleashed  like rottweiler fighting dogs  against almost all progressive governments in the middle east  but also against china and russia  extremist muslims  extremist christians  even extremist buddhists in turn  the politicians in the united states are regularly supported  financially  by the regimes  including those of saudi arabia  bahrain  etc   that are spreading  relentlessly  throughout the world  the most intolerant and grotesquely violent religious concepts despite their essential servility and cowardice  even some north american mainstream media outlets are now actively discussing various schemes involving the financing of the clinton foundation by saudi arabia  alongside several leading transnational corporations and wall street s largest banks  on its  breaking news   as far back as in   cnn reported the donations to the william j  clinton foundation include amounts of   million to   million from the kingdom of saudi arabia  the bill and melinda gates foundation and real estate mogul stephen bing  a personal friend of the clintons the clintons came under intense pressure during hillary clinton s campaign for the democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the foundation and to the clinton presidential library in arkansas bill clinton agreed to the release of the list after president elect barack obama nominated hillary clinton to become secretary of state the governments of kuwait and qatar are also on the list  as is saudi businessman nasser al rashid  who has close ties to the saudi royal family  saudi sheikh mohammed h  al amoudi  reputed to be one of the richest men in the world  is among the donors as well  both saudis contributed in the   million to   million range  a group called friends of saudi arabia and the dubai foundation appear in the same category   as recently as on august     the new york times wrote something similar  essentially reconfirming the validity of the earlier reports  while adding many more details and adjusting the figures  the kingdom of saudi arabia donated more than   million  through a foundation  so did the son in law of a former ukrainian president whose government was widely criticized for corruption and the murder of journalists  a lebanese nigerian developer with vast business interests contributed as much as   million for years the bill  hillary and chelsea clinton foundation thrived largely on the generosity of foreign donors and individuals who gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the global charity  but now  as mrs  clinton seeks the white house  the funding of the sprawling philanthropy has become an achilles  heel for her campaign and  if she is victorious  potentially her administration as well  long time clinton s top aide  huma abedin  who spent part of her childhood in saudi arabia  has been an intermediary between the former secretary of state and pro saudi interests  she also negotiated financial support for ms  clinton from mr  chagouri and other individuals  organizations and businesses originating from the middle east the accusations and evidence keep coming in  from different media outlets  both left wing and right wing  on august     the conservative breitbart news stated  khizr khan  the muslim gold star father that the mainstream media and former secretary of state hillary clinton have been using to criticize donald j  trump  has deep ties to the government of saudi arabia and to international islamist investors through his own law firm  in addition to those ties to the wealthy islamist nation  khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the united states and has deep ties to the  clinton cash  narrative through the clinton foundation    hillary s saudi sponsorshillary clinton s dependence on saudi sponsors has been strongly influencing her decision to maintain a foreign policy in the service of riyadh and support for various terrorist groups controlled by saudi arabia and qatar  in and beyond the middle east region  in reality  she is simply representing  continuity  of an already existing  deadly trend  the regime has been  evolving  for decades  but especially since the ronald reagan years  republicans or democrats  it truly matters very little  both parties spread terror all over the world  true  george w  bush invaded iraq  but people like bill clinton are close friends and supporters of paul kagame  the rwandese  butcher of congo   with the blood of some  million people on his hands  democrat and  moderate   bill clinton  was also responsible for the criminal bombing and destruction of socialist yugoslavia  and so it goes but under barack obama s rule  the last hope for an independent middle east and the arab world has virtually evaporated  libya has been destroyed  the syrian civil war was launched from washington  london and paris  saudis bathed rebellious yemen in blood using uk and us produced weapons  virtually all  arab spring revolutions  were infiltrated and diverted  and in bahrain  the shi a majority was literally raped by saudi arabia and its own ruthless rulers  with british advisors standing by the us and europe have kept selling arms to the gulf  building new military bases while supporting the most appalling and bloodthirsty regimes the  obama   hilary  clinton era  has greatly  improved  the symbioses of western imperialism  big business  and pro western fascist regimes worldwide  but particularly in the middle east and africa this toxic embrace has proved fatal to millions of people in these two parts of the world  hopes for self governance have been ruined  corpses keep piling up in syria  iraq  libya  yemen  south sudan  somalia  the democratic republic of congo  drc   and elsewhere the west does not care  as long as it stays in charge of the  show   and for as long as hundreds of billions of dollars are made by weapons  producers  even if millions are dying  there is still an uninterrupted flow of raw materials to the west and japan  therefore  it is  business as usual    un people  and their lives are worth nothing at one point  russia  iran  china and others have said  enough is enough  let s fight against the true terrorists  let s fight isis and other bigots  let s give a hand to the independence minded  socially oriented patriots  predictably   this led to total outrage in washington  london  and paris  and tokyo   disobedience and rebellion against the global  western  order could not be tolerated  it had to be crushed  even at the cost of new and deadly world war nato  washington  europe  japan  and south korea  all started a direct confrontation policy against russia  china  iran  north korea  dprk  and other members of the  coalition of daring   brazil  an important member of brics  was recently destroyed by the extreme right coup supported by the west even the republican presidential candidate donald trump  in his rare moments of sanity  is clearly aware of the danger  he does not wish to confront russia  he is obviously not willing to sacrifice tens of millions of human lives for some grotesque dreams of total world domination by a market fundamentalism backed by the white  or western  supremacist dogmas but trump s moments of sanity are defined as  madness  by the mainstream propaganda  not surprisingly  as was correctly stated by the great indian thinker  arundhati roy  some several years ago   now war is called peace and black is called white   orwellian indeed  with a vengeance the clinton campaignthe clinton campaign has gone into overdrive  it attempts to distract attention from its own funding scandals  by accusing donald trump s aides of receiving financing from abroad  trump is now described as  russia s agent  this game   it is all self serving  nothing to do with the interests of the world  or even the interests of the common  american people  for as long as the general political trend of the west does not radically change  or for as long as the west is not stopped by outside forces  perpetual wars will continue  monstrous genocides in africa  the destruction of entire states and regions in the middle east  all this could easily spread to other parts of the planet it is clear now that if provoked and confronted  countries like china  russia and iran would not hesitate to fight back  they also may fight for others   for their tortured allies the western implants and their buddies  mujahedeen al qaida  have already destroyed afghanistan and the soviet union  isis  another mutant unleashed by the west and its allies  have been devastating iraq  syria  libya and now what is left of afghanistan these  movements  have really nothing to do with islam  they were manufactured in washington  riyadh  london  and doha  and most likely even in tel aviv   for several concrete purposes  all of them thoroughly foul they are making sure to ruin the socialist nature of islam  insisting exclusively on the implementation of outdated  medieval fundamentalist interpretations huma abedin s mother  dr  saleha mahmood abedin  is one of the founding members of the muslim sisterhood  and chairperson of the  international islamic committee for woman and child   iicwc   she is also a well known writer and editor based in saudi arabia  her organization  iicwc  had repeatedly argued that laws banning female circumcision should be revoked  as well as laws prohibiting child marriage and marital rape  during her visit to ksa  hillary clinton spoke at the islamic college of dar el hekma  where dr  saleha abedin was a vice dean  shoulder to shoulder with her favorite aide   huma was this just an insignificant episode  like those millions of dollars in saudi arabian funding for clinton s foundation  like the us  foreign policy  in the gulf and in the middle east  like spreading muslim extremist groups to all corners of the world  from africa  the middle east  to southeast asia and even china  like unleashing conservative islam against socialist muslim countries too many  episodes   too much blood  it is time to say what is by now obvious   the us establishment is not fighting  muslim terrorism  or even  extremism   it is manufacturing it  and injecting it everywhere  the only real enemy that washington  london and paris have  for decades  even for centuries  is the anti colonialist struggle  and the burning desire of people  worldwide  to terminate the west s global dictatorship   philosopher  novelist  filmmaker and investigative journalist  andre vltchek has covered wars and conflicts in dozens of countries  his latest books are   exposing lies of the empire

scarborough has found himself the subject of  shall we say  criticism because of his insanely pro trump bias   something that bothers pretty much everyone at msnbc  in fact  their relationship has traditionally been so strong that scarborough bragged about giving the donald debate tips  recently scarborough was busted revealing his pro trump bias in  hot mic  comments captured during a commercial break  the  morning joe  host can be heard steering mika brzezinski away from tougher topics like immigration in his effort to provide the billionaire with a softball interview following trump s repeated refusals to disavow the ku klux klan   something that would be easy for anyone who did not depend so heavily on them for support   scarborough expressed what can only be referred to as disgust during a segment of the show on monday  it s breathtaking  that is disqualifying right there  to say you don t know about the ku klux klan   scarborough said   you don t know about david duke  on sunday  trump acknowledged his heavy support from white supremacists  including former kkk grand wizard david duke  but said it would be unfair to renounce the white power rangers supporting him until he has more information  just so you understand  i don t know anything about david duke  ok   trump told cnn s jake tapper   i don t know anything about what you re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists  i have to look at the group  i mean  i don t know what group you re talking about   he added despite tapper s repeated clarifications that he was talking about the ku klux klan   you wouldn t want me to condemn a group that i know nothing about  i d have to look  scarborough called this course of action  stunning  in that it  isn t buying him a single vote   i mean is he really so stupid that he thinks southerners aren t offended by the ku klux klan and david duke  is he really so ignorant of southern voters that he thinks this is the way to their heart   to go neutral  to play switzerland when you re talking about the klan  and to say he doesn t know enough information about the klan to condemn them   exactly what does donald trump expect to learn in the next  hours about the klan  watch the segment below featured image via screengrab   \n",

rejected on monday an appeal from texas officials seeking to restore the state s strict voter id law  as is the court s custom  its brief order in the case  abbott v  veasey  no    gave no reasons for turning down the appeal  but chief justice john g  roberts jr  issued an unusual statement explaining that the supreme court remains free to consider the case after further proceedings in the lower courts  the texas law  enacted in   requires voters seeking to cast their ballots at the polls to present photo identification  like a texas driver s or gun license  a military id or a passport  federal courts have repeatedly ruled that the law is racially discriminatory  the texas law was at first blocked under section  of the federal voting rights act  which required some states and localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal permission before changing voting procedures  after the supreme court effectively struck down section  in  in shelby county v  holder  an alabama case  texas officials announced that they would start enforcing the id law  after a   trial in   judge nelva gonzales ramos of federal district court in corpus christi struck down the law on oct   in a   opinion  she said that it had been adopted  with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose  and that its effect was to disenfranchise  a disproportionate number of   and hispanics    in   a   panel of the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit  in new orleans  vacated part of the ruling concerning the law s purpose but affirmed the part concerning its effect  last july  the full fifth circuit largely adopted the panel s distinctions and reasoning  and it returned the case to the trial court to consider an appropriate remedy  texas officials nonetheless asked the supreme court to review the appeals court s ruling immediately  the people and groups challenging the law  the officials said   presented no evidence that the law resulted in diminished minority political participation or prevented even a single person from voting    the challengers responded that about    registered voters in texas  or about  percent of all registered voters in the state  lacked the required forms of id  the law  they said   disproportionately affects minority voters at a statistically significant rate    on monday  chief justice roberts wrote that the case would be better suited for supreme court review after the lower courts completed their work  ken paxton  texas  attorney general  said he was disappointed that the court  did not immediately take our case     chief justice roberts made it very clear that the case will be an even stronger posture for supreme court review after further proceedings in lower courts   mr  paxton said in a statement   texas enacted a common sense voter id law to safeguard the integrity of our elections  and we will continue to fight for the law    j  gerald hebert of the campaign legal center  which represents voters challenging the law  said he was pleased that  the justices recognize that this case does not merit review at this time     texas  which ranks poorly in voter participation  should work to ensure that every eligible voter in the state is able to cast a ballot going forward   mr  hebert said in a statement    \n",

alongside the western border with syria  where the militant group is also in retreat  the capture of hawija was a boost for the iraqi government  which faces a separate crisis in the north of the country  where the kurdish minority last month voted overwhelmingly in support of independence for their autonomous region  in hawija  state tv showed footage of iraqi forces raising flags in one of the town s squares while humvees patrolled empty streets littered with car wrecks  houses riddled with bullets and shattered storefronts   graphics on  iraqi kurds  independence push    here   the

into direct contact with kurdish peshmerga fighters who control kirkuk  a multi ethnic region claimed by both baghdad and the kurdistan regional government  krg   kirkuk shaped up as a flashpoint last month when the krg included the city in the referendum on kurdish independence in northern iraq    we don t want any aggression or confrontations but the federal authority must be imposed in the disputed areas   iraqi prime minister haider al abadi told a news conference in paris with french president emmanuel macron  macron offered to mediate between the iraqi government and kurdish regional authorities  and promised to maintain a military presence there until islamic state was defeated  the iraqi government has imposed sanctions in response to the independence vote  but abadi said he could understand the kurds   aspirations   provided they were expressed in accordance with the constitution  the outcome of the referendum has raised concerns in iraq and abroad that a conflict might break out there along ethnic lines  potentially weakening the campaign against islamic state  turkey  which is battling a three decade old insurgency by its own kurdish militants  has led regional opposition to the iraqi kurds  independence hopes  stepping up his rhetoric on the issue  president tayyip erdogan said turkey would soon close its border with northern iraq and shut its air space in

decision will be made on closing oil taps in the region  that will be made by us  turkey  iran and iraq s central government will do so together   erdogan s stance has been backed by iran  after meeting erdogan in tehran on wednesday  supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said iran and turkey should prevent the iraqi kurds from declaring independence  relations have been cool between shi ite iran and mainly sunni turkey  but both have been alarmed by the independence vote  fearing it will encourage separatism among their own kurdish populations  the kurds are the region s fourth largest ethnic group  spread across iran  turkey  syria and iraq  all of which oppose any moves towards a kurdish state  iraq launched an offensive on sept   to dislodge islamic state from the hawija area  where up to   people were estimated to be trapped  according to the united nations   the militants control the border town of al qaim and the region surrounding it   they also hold parts of the syrian side of the border  but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two different sets of hostile forces   a u s  backed  kurdish led coalition and syrian government troops with foreign shi ite militias backed by iran and russia  islamic state s cross border  caliphate  effectively collapsed in july  when u s  backed iraqi forces captured mosul  the group s de facto capital in iraq  in a grueling battle which lasted nine months  the militants  leader  abu bakr al baghdadi  who declared the caliphate from mosul in mid   released an audio recording last week

replacement for the affordable care act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose  a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former president barack obama s signature health law  but the plan was attacked by democrats as a step back from the affordable care act s protections  and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible  if anything  the proposal      by senators bill cassidy of louisiana  a medical doctor  and susan collins of maine  a moderate republican      may show how difficult it will be for republicans to enact a replacement for the affordable care act  legislation that can pass muster in the more conservative house may not win enough support in the senate  a bill with broad appeal in the senate may fail in the house  under the proposal  states could stay with the affordable care act  or they could receive a similar amount of federal money  which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance   we are moving the locus of repeal to state government   mr  cassidy said   states should have the right to choose    the proposal shares some features with house republican proposals  it would encourage greater use of health savings accounts and eliminate the requirement for most americans to have insurance or pay a tax penalty  but the option for states to keep the affordable care act alive will rankle the most conservative republicans who have been trying for nearly seven years to blow it up   obamacare is flawed  failing and not fixable  and it needs to be fully repealed   said representative mark meadows of north carolina  the chairman of the house freedom caucus  a stalemate between the house and senate would leave in place mr  obama s health law  but efforts by president trump and congress to undermine it could send health insurance markets into a tailspin  on friday  as one of his first official acts as president  mr  trump signed an executive order that could allow officials to ease up on enforcement of the mandate requiring most americans to have insurance  supporters of the affordable care act panned the   proposal   millions of americans would be kicked off their plans     costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket  and protections for people with   conditions  such as cancer  would be gutted   said the senate democratic leader  chuck schumer of new york  ronald f  pollack  the executive director of families usa  a   consumer group  said the bill  falls way short of providing the protections and coverage people have under the affordable care act    ms  collins said the bill would allow states to  keep the affordable care act if it is working for their residents    but she predicted that most states would choose something different  under the   bill  states could enroll people who would otherwise be uninsured in health plans providing basic coverage  these   health plans are intended to protect consumers against catastrophic medical expenses  they would cover generic versions of prescription drugs  and they would also have to cover recommended childhood immunizations without    states would contract with one or more insurers to offer this coverage  consumers could buy  more robust coverage  if they want  mr  cassidy said  but they could be automatically enrolled  by default  in the   health plans providing basic coverage   a state could say   all those eligible are enrolled unless they choose not to be    he explained  this  passive enrollment  would provide insurers with a large pool of customers  including many healthy people  without the coercion of an  individual mandate   mr  cassidy said   we think that we could cover more people than obamacare   mr  cassidy said  although he acknowledged that the effects of his bill had not been analyzed by the congressional budget office  which serves as capitol hill s official scorekeeper  if a state opts out of the affordable care act  many of the federal insurance standards established under the law would no longer apply  the bill would repeal federal benefit mandates that  often force americans to pay for coverage they don t need and can t afford   mr  cassidy said  but some protections would remain in place  parents would still be allowed to keep children on their insurance until the age of   and insurers could not impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits  the   bill  called the patient freedom act  would eliminate not only the unpopular individual mandate  but also the federal requirement for larger employers to offer coverage to   employees  mr  cassidy said that senators shelley moore capito of west virginia and johnny isakson of georgia  both republicans  were also sponsors of the bill  the senate majority leader  mitch mcconnell  republican of kentucky  and the no   senate republican  john cornyn of texas  were sponsors of a similar bill that mr  cassidy introduced in   but the legislative landscape is different now  republicans in congress can repeal the affordable care act  with support from mr  trump  in the senate  they will need help from democrats to adopt a replacement because republicans are eight votes shy of the  needed to stop a filibuster    \n",

and symbolism  outlined in his  book the  planet and its sequels  there is an undiscovered planet beyond neptune that follows a long  elliptical orbit  reaching the inner solar system roughly every   years  this planet is called nibiru  although jupiter was the planet associated with the god marduk in babylonian cosmology  according to sitchin  nibiru  whose name was replaced with marduk in original legends by the babylonian ruler of the same name in an attempt to co opt the creation for himself  leading to some confusion among readers  collided catastrophically with tiamat  a goddess in the babylonian creation myth the enûma eliš   which he considers to be another planet once located between mars and jupiter  this collision supposedly formed the planet earth  the asteroid belt  and the comets  sitchin states that when struck by one of planet nibiru s moons  tiamat split in two  and then on a second pass nibiru itself struck the broken fragments and one half of tiamat became the asteroid belt  the second half  struck again by one of nibiru s moons  was pushed into a new orbit and became today s planet earth    according to sitchin  nibiru  called  the twelfth planet  because  sitchin claimed  the sumerians  gods given conception of the solar system counted all eight planets  plus pluto  the sun and the moon  was the home of a technologically advanced human like extraterrestrial race called the anunnaki in sumerian myth  who sitchin states are called the nephilim in genesis  he wrote that they evolved after nibiru entered the solar system and first arrived on earth probably   years ago  looking for minerals  especially gold  which they found and mined in africa  sitchin states that these  gods  were the rank and file workers of the colonial expedition to earth from planet nibiru   there is a lot of confusion about the origin of the word nephilim and what it means  in hebrew it literally means to fall  as in fallen angel  the bible  the talmud and the koran  where they are referred to as djinn  all speak of fallen angels    in the book of genesis in the bible it relates how the nephilim produced children with humans  one was even depicted as killing japheth  noah s son  and taking his place whereupon he fathered many children with japheth s unsuspecting wife which eventually populated much of northern europe   in the following video  journey into the world of fallen angels  satan  shadow people  aliens  demons  anunnaki  archons  ancient giants   ancient aliens    genetic hybrids  almost all of what we know about the nephilim comes from the holy bible in genesis chapter   if you ve studies or looked into the nephilim at all  or even if you haven t  i m sure you ll find the video below refreshingly different than many other videos on the topic  i certainly did  and i ve seen a ton    watch the video    locklip  source    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                when tidjane thiam took over at credit suisse last july  he laid out a new direction for a financial giant with a storied investment banking history  do less investment banking  and he used forceful language in doing so  he has referred to once core businesses      such as trading in distressed bonds and derivatives      as  ugly ducklings    he has suggested publicly that traders increased their investments in risky debt without his knowledge  instead  mr  thiam said  the firm should dedicate itself to cultivating billionaires in china  indonesia and africa  the message  the future for the company is in managing the wealth of others  one year in  credit suisse stock is down  percent  and the investment bank  the second largest in switzerland after ubs  is in open revolt  credit suisse has a wide range of businesses  like overseeing the fortunes of billionaires and managing initial public offerings for technology companies  but for decades  the bank has been dominated  both culturally and financially  by a richly paid banking elite  these deal makers in new york and london are now furious at mr  thiam  not just for cutting their pay but also because they resent his blaming them for the   billion in losses that the firm has suffered on his watch  across europe  banking giants like barclays  deutsche bank  ubs and royal bank of scotland have  to varying degrees  moved away from traditional investment banking activities because of increased regulation and volatile markets  sluggish growth in large european economies      not to mention the remarkable phenomenon of negative interest rates      have not helped matters  either  but what makes the situation at credit suisse stand out is that mr  thiam appears to have done little to cloak his disdain for these activities  the question is not whether mr  thiam is right to grab power and capital from these declining businesses but whether his blunt  domineering style as a change agent will end up alienating bankers instead of winning them over   it is never easy to tell people that whole parts of the business that have put bread on their table and bought them a second house have become uneconomic   said guy moszkowski  a longtime securities analyst at autonomous research  by any measure  mr  thiam is an unconventional choice to lead an investment bank  born to a prominent family in ivory coast  he cut short a career at mckinsey  company in paris in  to join a   government in his home country as a top banker and minister  following a military coup in   mr  thiam returned to mckinsey  and in   he was named chief executive of prudential  the british insurance conglomerate      becoming the first african to head a major listed company in britain     and snugly tailored  mr  thiam has an air about him of not suffering fools  he had a successful run at prudential  no relation to an american company with a similar name  overcoming an uproar following a failed bid to buy the asian operations of the american international group  along the way  he became one of london s more celebrated executives and a regular on the circuit of global    that he has not bent to the complaints of bankers and traders in unprofitable businesses should not come as a surprise   there needs to be a cultural change   he said in a televised interview in march  in which he argued that bankers were pursuing risky trades to justify their high pay   a lot of the problems in the investment bank are that people are trying to generate revenue at all costs    in turn  deal makers in london and new york  who have seen their bonuses slashed by nearly  percent  are not hiding their dislike of the man  more than any other bank on wall street  credit suisse restricts the cash portion of its bonuses  allocating large chunks in company stock  which has halved in value  so when their new chief executive gave a speech in may and said that credit suisse s stock price  reflected reality   bankers  especially the many who have worked at the firm for decades  could not believe it  on credit suisse s newly renovated trading floor in new york  several bankers  who spoke on the condition of anonymity  grumbled that mr  thiam had  lost the building   which is wall street parlance for chief executives who no longer command the respect of their traders  and when he has appeared on television in recent months  employees loudly vented their frustrations at the screen  according those bankers  who witnessed the events but were not authorized to speak publicly  mr  thiam was hailed during his first visit to the trading floor in new york last year  but the reception during a more recent appearance was chillier  said two employees who were on the floor during his visits but were not authorized to speak publicly  in particular  many at credit suisse find mr  thiam s personal style to be jarring at a time when thousands are being laid off and the stock is trading at a multiyear low  this is particularly true when compared with brady w  dougan  his   predecessor  mr  thiam s own dealings with the media are handled by a british firm  powerscourt  he enjoys a robust social life and has been seen doing the rounds at clubs in london and davos  switzerland  and he recently purchased a luxury home in herrliberg  an exclusive lakeside enclave in zurich  to be sure  analysts agree that credit suisse can no longer rely on trading derivatives with firms like deutsche bank as a profit center  instead  mr  thiam is encouraging his deal makers to support the firm s private bankers in asia  by providing loans to   magnates in indonesia or helping billionaire clients in china with initial public offerings  mr  thiam is clearly enamored with the prospect of tapping growth markets in emerging economies  he has been to china and broader asia at least four times in his new capacity  and his business cards carry a mandarin translation on the back  mr  thiam s defenders say that with the future of credit suisse in doubt  he has no choice but to make these painful changes and that resistance from   traders and bankers should not deter him  and it is also true that wealth managers in switzerland and asia  where mr  thiam is adding resources  are embracing the new strategy  following last year s losses  he also asked his board for a  percent cut in his bonus  taking in     million for the six months he worked last year  to date  the credit suisse board appears to be standing with mr  thiam  indeed  having had two wall street chiefs since   the board clearly believes that only a prominent nonbanker like mr  thiam can wean the firm off a line of business that has so long defined it  nevertheless  directors were not happy with his televised comments in march when mr  thiam suggested that traders at the bank were hiding losses from him  mr  thiam quickly corrected himself at a conference that same day and said no limits were breached  though not without taking another dig at his traders by questioning their judgment  mr  thiam also called these   traders and offered what a spokeswoman for the bank said was a  clarification  of his remarks   the board is  percent behind the strategy  tidjane and the executive board   said richard e  thornburgh  a former credit suisse banker with  years of experience at the firm who is now chairman of the board s risk committee  with morale in new york at a low point  mr  thornburgh has had recent meetings with top bankers and traders  hearing them out and urging them to remain focused on their clients  for many  though  this is easier said than done  it is unusual  after all  for an incoming chief executive to be so publicly critical of employees responsible for a quarter of a firm s revenue  that is particularly true on wall street  where punctured vanities can quickly harm a firm  as productive bankers head for the exits in droves  over the last six months  at least  bankers and traders have left the firm  with many of these coming from credit suisse s once prestigious technology unit in san francisco  the culture clash at credit suisse recalls a similar dispute at morgan stanley a decade ago  like mr  thiam  philip j  purcell was a former whiz kid consultant from mckinsey who preferred slow and steady brokers over bankers with big egos and even bigger paychecks  a   uprising forced mr  purcell s departure  since power on wall street was then still in the hands of deal makers and traders  with wealth managers now ascendant  mr  thiam seems willing to accept the wounded cries of his own bankers as a painful necessity if his grand plan is to succeed   is there a vision  is there a direction   mr  thiam asked aloud last year in a speech introducing his strategy   the germans say that the horrible end is better than horror without end      \n",

perfectly acceptable topics to discuss with our young children  whatever you do  just don t mention god a public hearing is taking place wednesday morning in the massachusetts state house to look into a controversial sex survey given to middle school and high school students developed by the centers for disease control and called the  youth risk behavior survey   the survey asks students as young as  a series of very personal and highly ideological questions the survey asks students if they are homosexual and if they are transgender  it also asks if they have had oral or anal sex and if they have performed such acts with up to six people whether or not they have carried a gun  smoked cigarettes  consumed alcohol and how much also appear on the questionnaire  as well as whether they have taken drugs  such as oxycontin  percocet  and vicodin  it asks how often their guardian uses a seat belt  if the youngster has a sexually transmitted disease  and where they sleep the group massresistance says the survey is  psychologically distorting  and will lead the child to think he is  abnormal if he is not doing it all   the group stated that  having children reveal personal issues about themselves and their family can have emotional consequences   they also complain that  the survey results are used by radical groups from planned parenthood to lgbt groups to persuade politicians to give more taxpayer money  these groups  though students fill out the survey anonymously  massresistance warns that  they are administered by the teacher in the classroom and there is often pressure for all kids to participate  the test is given nationally and not without controversy  the chicago tribune reported two years ago that a chicago teacher was reprimanded for telling students they had a  constitutional right  not to fill out the survey via  breitbart news   \n",

wolfgang schaeuble  agreed to become president of the parliament  clearing the way for another party to take his job  chancellor angela merkel will hope that schaeuble  deeply respected in germany for helping to steer the euro zone through its debt crisis  can stamp his authority on a fractious bundestag lower house that will include two more parties after sunday s federal election  merkel must assemble germany s first three way coalition since the  after her conservatives lost support and a far right party  the anti immigrant alternative for germany  afd   entered parliament for the first time in half a century  in a sign of the challenges ahead  andrea nahles  the social democrats  newly elected parliamentary leader  told reporters her party would hit conservatives  squarely in the

the post  told the rnd newspaper chain that schaeuble s move showed merkel s openness to a  jamaica  coalition  he also underscored his party s call for a shift in fiscal policy  schaeuble was criticized in southern europe  especially greece  for his insistence on tax hikes and spending cuts at a time of deep recession  but is popular at home for balancing the books and presiding over high growth and low unemployment  european commission president jean claude juncker  speaking in munich  said he did not think schaeuble s departure would soften the eu s approach to heavily indebted

do more to curb north korea s nuclear program and help reduce the gaping u s  trade deficit with beijing in talks on friday  even as he toned down the strident anti china rhetoric of his election campaign  trump spoke publicly of progress on a range of issues in his first u s  china summit   as did several of his top aides   but they provided few concrete specifics other than china s agreement to work together to narrow disagreements and find common ground for cooperation  as the two leaders wrapped up a florida summit overshadowed by u s  missile strikes in syria overnight  xi joined trump in stressing the positive mood of the meetings while papering over deep differences that have caused friction between the world s two biggest economies  trump s aides insisted he had made good on his pledge to raise concerns about china s trade practices and said there was some headway  with xi agreeing to a  day plan for trade talks aimed at boosting u s  exports and reducing china s trade surplus with the united states  speaking after the two day summit at trump s mar a lago resort in florida  u s  secretary of state rex tillerson also said that xi had agreed to increased cooperation in reining in north korea s missile and nuclear programs   though he did not offer any new formula for cracking pyongyang s defiant attitude   trump had promised during the campaign to stop what he called the theft of american jobs by china  many blue collar workers helped propel him to his unexpected election victory on nov   and trump is under pressure to deliver for them  the republican president tweeted last week that the united states could no longer tolerate massive trade deficits and job losses and that his meeting with xi  will be a very difficult one    on friday  the unpredictable trump not only set a different tone but also avoided any public lapses in protocol that chinese officials had feared could embarrass their leader   we have made tremendous progress in our relationship with china   trump told reporters as the two delegations met around tables flanked by large u s  and chinese flags   we will be making additional progress  the relationship developed by president xi and myself i think is outstanding   and i believe lots of very potentially bad problems will be going away   he added  without providing details  xi also spoke in mostly positive terms   we have engaged in deeper understanding  and have built a trust   he said   i believe we will keep developing in a stable way to form friendly relations     for the peace and stability of the world  we will also fulfill our historical responsibility    well  i agree with you  percent   trump replied  china s official xinhua news agency said xi had encouraged the united states to take part in the  one belt  one road  plan  xi s signature foreign policy imitative aimed at infrastructure development across asia  africa and europe  seen in some policy circles as a partial answer to the pivot to asia strategy of trump s predecessor barack obama  xi also hailed military to military exchanges and said china and the united states should  make good use of the dialogue mechanism to be established between the two countries  joint staffs of the armed forces   although xinhua did not give further details  chinese state media on saturday cheered the meeting as one that showed the world that confrontation between the two powers was not inevitable and established the tone for the development of u s  china relations  but in a sign that rough spots remained  tillerson afterwards described the discussions as  very frank and candid    president trump and president xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respect   he said  after the meeting  trump took xi on a walk around the manicured grounds of his lavish spanish style complex  trump could be seen chatting and gesturing to xi  who did the same  tillerson said trump had accepted xi s invitation to visit china and that they also agreed to upgrade a u s  china dialogue by putting the two presidents at the head of the forum  u s  commerce secretary wilbur ross said the chinese had expressed an interest in reducing china s trade surplus as a way of controlling their own inflation   that s the first time i ve heard them say that in a bilateral context   he said  ross declined to say whether the united states was ready to designate china a currency manipulator  however  referring to an upcoming report in which that issue would be addressed  although trump during the presidential election campaign had pledged to label china a currency manipulator on the first day of his administration  he has refrained from doing so   the highly anticipated u s  china summit was upstaged by u s  missile strikes overnight against a syrian air base from which trump said a deadly chemical weapon attack had been launched earlier in the week  it was the first direct u s  assault on the russian backed government of syrian president bashar al assad in six years of civil war   the swift action in syria could be interpreted as a signal especially to defiant nuclear armed north korea   and by extension  its ally china   as well as other countries like iran and russia of trump s willingness to use military force  north korea is developing missiles capable of hitting the united states  tillerson said xi agreed with trump that north korea s nuclear advances had reached a  very serious stage   he said trump also raised u s concerns about china s activities in the south

extraordinaires présenté par la chaîne de télévision rossiya   la vidéo dans laquelle la petite fille répond aux questions  chante des chansons et parle dans plusieurs langues a suscité un grand intérêt sur les réseaux sociaux    je me sens stupide par rapport à cet enfant     écrivaient les internautes dans les commentaires   ioulia deviatkina  la mère de bella  affirme que sa fille n est pas un enfant prodige  ses parents accordant simplement beaucoup d attention à son développement    les enfants n ont pas forcément besoin de parler sept langues  mais chaque petit est capable de maîtriser deux ou trois langues     assure ioulia   les parents de bella sont conscients que dans la vraie vie  la petite fille n utilisera pas les sept langues activement   c est tout simplement impossible    quand elle ira à l école  nous nous concentrerons sur l anglais  le français et le chinois     précise la mère de la petite fille     nous n avons pas peur que bella s ennuie en classe non plus  elle possède les connaissances obligatoires pour tout enfant de quatre ans  simplement  elle est capable de parler sur ces sujets   enfantins   dans plusieurs langues différentes     le gazouillis en français  la mère de la petite fille est linguiste de formation et enseigne l anglais aux enfants depuis sept ans  son père travaille à l institut de recherche radio  c est une famille de classe moyenne  cependant  pour les parents de bella  le développement de leur fille est l investissement le plus important  окт   в   pdt   initialement  les parents de bella voulaient qu elle parle couramment l anglais  ainsi  dès la naissance  sa mère lui parlait en deux langues  les alternant jour après jour  elle veillait à ce que les langues ne se mélangent pas et interdisait à sa fille d utiliser des mots russes dans les conversations en anglais   quand bella a eu  mois  ses parents ont rajouté le français  elle ne savait pas parler  mais pouvait montrer du doigt les objets nommés par les adultes  lire aussi   de jeunes mères russes racontent comment leur enfant a bouleversé leur vie  bella a appris à lire avant de commencer à parler  dès l âge de cinq mois  ses parents lui apprenaient à lire grâces à des cartes spéciales  par exemple  quand on montrait à bella  âgée de neuf mois  le mot   main   en russe ou en anglais  elle montrait sa main  avant l âge d un an  la petite fille a appris  de ces cartes avec ses parents  elle a commencéà lire couramment à l âge de deux ans  dessins animés en chinois  à deux ans  bella savait parler avec des phrases courtes et lire avec aisance dans trois langues  avant l âge de trois ans  ses parents ont rajouté le chinois au   programme     ioulia raconte que la petite fille montrait un grand intérêt pour la nouvelle langue

favorite toy  but there are no bullets involved   except maybe the bullet points they include in their scripts  dana loesch has transformed herself from useful fox news idiot to darling of the second amendment  and the nra is more than happy to put her stern but beautiful face on camera earlier this year  loesch and the nra put out a video recruiting ad they called  the clenched fist of truth   it accused the left of  assassinating real news  and using wedge issues like homophobia  racism  and sexism to stifle the views of conservative americans  in the video  schoolchildren are depicted on a playground just before loesch says they re being indoctrinated to believe trump is  another hitler   in short  it s disgusting  civil rights activist deray mckesson summed it up this nra ad is an open call to violence to protect white supremacy  if i made a video like this  i d be in jail  pic twitter com   deray mckesson   deray  june    the backlash was short lived  and in an environment as rich with news as the trump era  it was quickly forgotten  despite its gross  dangerous message now dana and the nra are back with a new ad  equally violent  this time aimed at the new york times  loesch carefully phrases her threats as a shot across the  proverbial  bow of the times  so as to avoid being accused of outright incitement  but the accusations in the video mirror perfectly the paranoia  suspicion  and resentment of trump fans who want to believe that news they don t like is  fake   and the final phrase in the video    we re coming for you    is as menacing as anything else the nra has done in a near derailing of the conversation  a few pundits misheard loesch s use of the word fisk  a  verb ing  of the last name of a writer considered easily debunked by right wingers who disagree with him   thinking instead that she had said  fist   if that seems like a silly thing to get hung up on  the context clears it up we re going to fisk the new york times and find out just what deep rich means to this old gray hag if you thought that said  fist   the meaning is changed considerably  their mistake wasn t just one of hearing  though   the tweet from the nra accompanying the video uses the hashtag  clenchedfistoftruth  the mistake is understandable  loesch didn t think so  she blew up at a few notable tweeters who made the error the new  orwellian video says  in part we ve had it with your constant protection of your democrat overlords  your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life somebody is confused about what s real and what s not   and it s not the new york times watch the video here   dloesch has a message for the  nytimes   we re coming for you   one non  fakenews story is not enough   nra

secret that world renowned political theorist noam chomsky does not want donald trump in the white house  and thinks it s an absolute tragedy that the presumptive republican nominee has even managed to get as far as he has in an interview with art is power  the author and mit professor criticized the donald for using  generalized anger  and his racist white supporters  fear of becoming a minority to his advantage  knowing full well that it was a strategy that would work in the polls  chomsky also likened trump s hateful rhetoric to adolf hitler as he explained trump s formula for success  so every time trump makes a nasty comment about whoever  his popularity goes up  because it s based on hate  you know  hate and fear  and it s unfortunately kind of reminiscent of something unpleasant  germany  not many years ago  chomsky pointed out how interesting this year s presidential primaries had been   not in a good way   and used the business mogul as a prime example  he s a clown   literally  he could be in the circus  he s getting huge support from people who are angry at everything  mostly white males  working class  middle class  poor white males  and their wives and traditional families  they are furious about everything  in his analysis of trump s campaign  chomsky explained that all the disgraced candidate had done was tap into america s nativism  in the past  americans had been worried about being  replaced  by germans or irish immigrants  all trump did was change the words to make his racist supporters scared of muslims and mexican immigrants   and he did a great job fear mongering and relentlessly attacking those specific minorities to achieve his goals you can watch chomsky rip trump below chomsky has expressed his disgust over the presidential candidate before  when he called the gop  the most dangerous organization in human history   criticizing it for creating the kind of hostile  extremist political environment that would allow a joker

endured all year long at the hands of black lives matter  la raza and other black and brown supremacist groups    chris matthews goes into hamster rationalization mode  hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women  but effeminate  low t manlets like chris matthews also have them  his first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say hillary won the debates  she didn t  then he says she had the best ad campaign  nobody believes advertising or anything you say  anymore chris  then matthews says she had the best ground game  she might have  but she was a terrible candidate  the half man  half alligator james carville looked ready to give chris a hug as the reality of hillary s defeat began to settle in on msnbc    the racist van jones whines about white people  van jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired  old leftist talking points from the  about the evil white male  especially white males that haven t been turned into geldings  he then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office  lmfao  really  dude  he then says immigrants are afraid now that trump is going to be president  no van  immigrants aren t afraid  illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say  fuck you   to u s  immigration law are afraid  as they should be  jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a so called white lash  he says trump s campaign was based on  throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others   umm  isn t that what the entire platform of the democratic party is  van  throwing away  nay  crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others   your entire career is based on just that  mr  jones    cbs does a mea culpa cbs published an article admitting how badly the press is biased cbs was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the network s shoddy coverage of the  election  this stunning article entitled  the unbearable smugness of the press  needed to be written  years ago  better late than never  cbs actually echoed what we in the manosphere and alt right have been saying since day one with the op ed piece  this is all symptomatic of modern journalism s great moral and intellectual failing  its unbearable smugness   had hillary clinton won  there d be a winking  we did it  feeling in the press  a sense that we were brave and called trump a liar and saved the republic  the eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us  so much for that  the audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate  it turned out  was rather limited  this was particularly true when it came to voters  the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it  trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him  they hate us  and have for some time  and can you blame them  journalists love mocking trump supporters  we insult their appearances  we dismiss them as racists and sexists  we emote on twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other  and yet we reject their feelings as invalid  damn  at least some people over there know why we hate them   that includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected   shameless activism got marxism  it s the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is not on the side of the average american  it hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet  the evil white male  the rebuke of a sorry candidate like hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoe in caught the smug son of a bitches off guard  their reactions are priceless  and need to be documented and remembered  these reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like return of kings and web sites like breitbart and drudge are sorely needed  indispensable resources in this day and age  we have not been getting the truth from media for generations  and now  as alternative voices appear  the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper  the once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for new world order socialism  the election night  horror show  only solidifies this point  we should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda  if nothing else to balance the scales  the media are not friends of the american public  ultimately  the tired old socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive   read more  did the anti donald trump riot in chicago help trump cruise to victory on tuesday      \n",

enforce a fragile partial    but neither the syrian government nor the rebel fighters      who briefly met face to face for the first time in nearly six years of war      signed the agreement  while the three powers agreed to establish a mechanism to monitor and enforce the nearly     they did not say what the mechanism should look like  deferring that issue for now  the statement  at least on paper  brought iran on board with recent new cooperation between russia and turkey  and it strengthened turkey s commitment to separating rebel groups it supports from jihadist groups  but representatives of the syrian delegations      both from the government and opposition      immediately expressed reservations  they emphasized that they had not signed on to a document that had been brokered by the main sponsors of the warring sides in the country  but not by syrians themselves  russia is the most powerful backer of the syrian government  which is also closely allied with iran  while turkey has been among the main supporters of rebel groups  despite the supposed   new clashes were reported in wadi barada  a besieged   area and source for most of the drinking water for damascus  the syrian capital  water supplies have been cut off for weeks  and the government and rebel sides have blamed each other  the agreement among iran  russia and turkey was announced a day after the syrian factions exchanged harsh words at the start of the talks  held in astana  capital of kazakhstan  a main result of the meeting was to firm up russia s growing role in the syria diplomacy  establishing the astana talks as a part of  but not a replacement for  the geneva process that has been spearheaded for years by the united nations and the united states  the new document said meetings in astana  a capital five time zones east of geneva with close ties to turkey but firmly within russia s sphere of influence  would be a forum to discuss specific issues that come up within the geneva framework  there had been tentative hopes among some rebel negotiators that russia might be ready to take on a more active role in seeking a political compromise  but there was no concrete progress on political issues  which were excluded from the narrowly focused talks  iran  russia and turkey affirmed their commitment  to the sovereignty  independence  unity and territorial integrity of the syrian arab republic as a multiethnic  multireligious  nonsectarian and democratic state   and their conviction  that there is no military solution to the syrian conflict and that it can only be solved through a political process    those sentiments echo principles that the united nations security council has laid out  the countries also reiterated  their determination to fight jointly  against the islamic state and against al qaeda s affiliate in syria  formerly known as the nusra front  pledging to  separate  them from armed opposition groups  that could be an important provision  since the syrian government led by president bashar   tends to classify all the opposition fighters indiscriminately as terrorist groups  and many have been unable or unwilling to separate themselves from forces of the former nusra front on the battlefield  the agreement did not specify how such a separation might occur  however  in astana  government representatives said that they still considered the rebel fighters to be terrorists and were waiting to see if turkey followed through on the agreement  rebel negotiators said the meetings had given them hope that russia might be open to hearing rebel concerns and become more willing to press the syrian government for a political resolution  but such optimism did not extend to iran  which had stuck to a harder line  staffan de mistura  the special united nations envoy for syria who had been invited to the astana talks  said in an interview after the joint statement was issued that in the interactions he had watched between russia and opposition commanders   the body language was of people who were seriously talking to each other and taking each other seriously    at the same time  rebels are concerned that the new agreement puts iran in the position of taking part in a   that its own militias have been accused of violating  the next round of talks between the syrian government and the opposition will occur on feb   in geneva  according to the announcement by the three countries  but diplomats in astana said it was unclear if that date was firm  bashar   the syrian ambassador to the united nations who led his government s delegation to the talks in astana  said an offensive by the government and its allied troops would continue  arguing that    terrorist groups  controlled ain   a town in wadi barada  residents in wadi barada say that some fighters from the former nusra front are present there  but that they are at most a tiny minority  also on tuesday  united nations officials appealed for more than   billion in funding this year to help millions of people displaced by the syrian conflict  the united nations refugee agency is asking for     billion to help at least    million people who have fled abroad  mainly to iraq  jordan  lebanon and turkey  and around     billion for an estimated    million internally displaced syrians    \n",

u s  president elect donald trump said that brexit would turn out to be a great thing and other countries would follow britain out of the european union but promised to strike a swift bilateral trade deal with the united kingdom  speaking in an interview with the times of london newspaper five days before his inauguration  trump described himself as a big fan of britain and endorsed last year s vote to leave the european union   i think brexit is going to end up being a great thing   trump said   i ll tell you  the fact that your pound sterling has gone down  great  because business is unbelievable in a lot of parts in the uk   the june  vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise  triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in britain since world war two and the biggest ever one day fall in sterling against the dollar  sterling has since fallen further against the u s  dollar as traders  businesses and investors fret about the type of relationship britain will have with its biggest single trading partner after it leaves the bloc  trump s election campaign seized on the brexit vote as an example of disillusioned voters rising up against the political establishment  and he forged a friendship with leading brexit campaigner nigel farage   a fierce critic of prime minister theresa may  trump s election has raised questions over the future of the so called  special relationship  that has underpinned close british american ties for decades  but in sunday s interview trump played up his ancestral ties to britain  saying his scottish mother was  so proud  of queen elizabeth  and said he was eager to get a trade deal done   we re gonna work very hard to get it done quickly and done properly  good for both sides   trump said   i will be meeting with   she s requesting a meeting and we ll have a meeting right after i get into the white house     we re gonna get something done very quickly   however  he predicted that more countries would seek to follow britain s example and quit the eu   i believe others will leave   he said   if refugees keep pouring into different parts of europe       i think it s gonna be very hard to keep it together because people are angry about it   he singled out german chancellor angela merkel   whose open door policies have allowed about   million refugees from syria  iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere into germany since mid    calling her immigration policy a catastrophic mistake     \n",

       "46  the seven fishermen aboard the carolina queen iii  a   scalloping boat that set out from norfolk  va  had been at sea for four days when the skies darkened off the coast of the rockaways  a powerful storm system that had already lashed the east coast  bringing tornadoes  thunder  lightning  high winds and heavy rains  was barreling down on them  homes had been flattened  vehicles had been tossed like tinkertoys and trees had been ripped from their roots  at least seven people had died  the crew knew they were in for nasty weather  but they were scallopers  weather comes with the job  as night fell on feb    the winds started to blow across new york city  at   p  m  a large section of a facade collapsed on fordham street in the bronx  at    a   was blown over on the upper level of the george washington bridge  by midnight  there were reports of downed trees and power lines around the region  off the coast  winds were gusting up to  miles an hour  according to data collected by the national weather service  the men on the carolina queen had a decision to make  one successful   scalloping trip can pull in a profit of      each fisherman can make     on a good voyage  the crew was   fishing  about  miles off the coast  as the storm approached  the men decided to steer the vessel closer to shore      past a predetermined demarcation line that would stop the clock on their allotted   yearly limit at sea  the carolina queen had only  bags of scallops       pounds per bag      on ice in the hold  with the scallop season drawing to a close  this trip was the crew s last chance for a major haul  when the skies cleared  they expected  they would get back to business  but shortly after  a  m  on feb    the vessel  battered by wind and waves  ran aground  soon  one of its generators failed and the carolina queen issued a desperate mayday  setting in motion a harrowing rescue operation  in the next few hours  a coast guard boat capsized and fire department vessels were unable to reach the stranded scallop boat because of the weather  ultimately  the coast guard decided to undertake a daring airlift operation by a crew dispatched from atlantic city   nothing about this really was routine   said deputy chief george healy of the new york fire department   this was a very treacherous operation    the airmen and women at coast guard air station atlantic city keep a goldfish in their  survival shop   where they gear up before missions  the swimmer  as they call it  is named ashton  a reference to ashton kutcher in his role as a coast guard rescue swimmer in the widely mocked     movie  the guardian       and a wry acknowledgment that the coast guard is not always accorded the kind of respect reserved for other branches of the military  but the coast guard plays a vital role in protecting the nation s maritime interests  since it was absorbed into the department of homeland security  combating terrorism has been added to the sprawling mission carried out by its      reserve  civilian and auxiliary men and women serving around the world  despite the expanded responsibilities  its budget has been buffeted in his  state of the coast guard address  adm  paul f  zukunft  the coast guard commandant  said  percent of the acquisition budget had been slashed over the previous four years   i m concerned that aging platforms and crumbling infrastructure continue to hinder mission success   admiral zukunft said   today we re seeing significant increase in demand across all of our daily activities  and it limits our ability to respond to major contingencies  indeed  we are facing a time like none other in our nearly  years of service    air coast guard station atlantic city  at the william j  hughes federal aviation administration technical center at the atlantic city international airport  is the closest air station to new york city  it was formed in  when coast guard air station brooklyn and group air station cape may  new jersey  were merged  the squadron comprises    dolphin helicopters  its crews are responsible for covering hundreds of miles of coastline in connecticut  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  delaware  maryland and virginia      as well as interior bays and rivers such as chesapeake bay  the delaware and hudson rivers and long island sound  two helicopters are always ready to be airborne within  minutes  lt  mark bruno    was the aircraft commander on duty on feb   when the call came in that a fishing vessel off the coast of the rockaways was in trouble  at   a  m  his team was dispatched to new york city  the dolphin helicopter can fly faster than  m  p  h  but it would still take about  minutes to reach the carolina queen  the helicopter crew members      including lt  j  g  maggie champlin    the   petty officer second class kensuke caldwell    the flight mechanic and petty officer third class joe     the rescue swimmer      took off in darkness shortly before  a  m  knowing very little about what they might find   we knew it was a fishing vessel  and fishing vessels are always tricky   lieutenant bruno said  there are lines and riggings to contend with  and there often is very little room for error  especially when trying to pluck someone off the deck  and it can be more complicated when the vessel is no longer afloat   normally  when a boat is on the waves  it has a certain rhythm   lieutenant bruno said  that is not the case when it has run aground  as the crew sped north  it was in communication with the fire department  which arrived on the scene shortly before  a  m  it was soon clear that this would not be a straightforward operation  the first distress signal to the outside world from the carolina queen was an emergency flare that lit up the sky shortly after   a  m  aaron bell    a ups worker who lives in an apartment near the water on beach  place in queens  said it was so windy and foggy  you couldn t even see the ocean  from the shore  but someone spotted the flare  chief healy said the first  call came in at   a  m  emergency responders were on the scene at    chief healy has  years on the job  he has seen all sorts of disasters and is not one for overstatement  the ship was not more than  yards from shore  but once contact was made with those on board  it was clear that the ship and its crew were in dire trouble   we directed the captain and crew to put on exposure suits   chief healy said   we had a fear that the boat was going to capsize    waves were cresting as high as  feet and breaking on the ship  the scallopers were as stranded as they might have been in the open ocean  as the fire department was responding  a   coast guard rescue boat was also racing to the scene  dispatched by coast guard station jones beach  the boat capsized in the rough waters near east rockaway inlet before it reached the carolina queen  its crew members had to save themselves  swimming to shore  the team aboard the helicopter learned of that accident as they made their way up the coast   you get a little nervous hearing that   lieutenant bruno said   but it was good to know they were safe    that part of the incident is still under investigation the coast guard declined to answer questions about what might have gone wrong  the fire department had rescue boats to deploy  but the seas were so severe that the f  d  n  y  decided to wait for air support  a fire department helicopter  only a short distance away at floyd bennett field  was grounded because of the heavy fog  the crew of the carolina queen would have to wait  scallop fishing may not conjure up the   of those catching crabs in the icy waters of the bering strait or the exploits of   tuna fisherman chronicled on shows like  the deadliest catch    but the most dangerous fishing grounds in america remain those off the northeast coast      more dangerous than the bering sea  according to data collected by the centers for disease control and prevention  from  to   the years covered by the agency s data   people died while fishing at sea and  of them were in the northeast  the scallop industry had the   rate of fatalities   deaths per    workers  among all workers in the united states over the same period  according to the c  d  c  there were four deaths per    workers  the size of the crew and the time at sea contribute to the dangers  drew minkiewicz  a lawyer who represents the fisheries survival fund  said that since   the number of vessels permitted to fish for scallops has been limited  and with fewer unregistered ships at sea  there have been fewer accidents  the atlantic sea scallop      placopecten magellanicus      has been popular since the   when norwegian immigrants first scoured the seas south of new bedford  mass  the supply could swing between scarcity and plenty  but in the  huge algae blooms known as brown tides appeared several years in a row and threatened to destroy the scallops  ecosystem on the east coast  even after those tides passed  the industry almost did itself in by overfishing  only after regulations were passed in the  and the industry banded together with the scientific community to improve fishing techniques did the fisheries rebound  now  scalloping along the atlantic coast from maine to north carolina is among the most lucrative fishing in the world  in   the catch was estimated to be worth more than   million  most of the ships that fish these waters are registered with the national marine fisheries service  including the carolina queen  the ship is owned by the wells scallop company  a   family operation that stretches back four generations  bill wells  who runs the company  declined to talk about the incident  through an industry spokesman  he said he wanted to thank both the coast guard and the new york city emergency responders and said that the incident had been classified as an accident  with no fault found on the part of the crew and no fines issued against his company  the industry operates under strict guidelines  many aimed at ensuring sustainability of the fisheries  to fish some areas with known scallop beds  a permit is needed  and the haul is capped    fishing  on the other hand  is restricted only by the annual     limit  the clock is always ticking   we get so few days to go out  we have to find every efficiency to maximize our days at sea   said joe gilbert  who owns empire fisheries and  as captain of a boat called the rigulus  is part of the   scalloping community  in preparation for the carolina queen s voyage  the crew would have spent days getting ready  buying     in groceries  loading more than    pounds of ice and prepping the equipment on the   vessel  the vessel steamed north from the chesapeake bay  traveling  hours to reach the coast off new jersey  where the crew would probably have started fishing  then the work would begin  it is pretty standard for a crew to work eight hours on and take four hours off  but in reality it often is more like nine hours on and three off  if you are a good sleeper  you are lucky to get two hours    before heading back on deck  the huge tows scouring the ocean bed for scallops dredge for about  minutes and are then hauled up  their catch dumped on deck before the tows are reset and plunged back into the water  a process that can be done in as little as  minutes  while the dredge did its work  the crew on duty on the carolina queen sorted through the muddy mix of rocks and sand and other flotsam on the ship s deck  looking for the wavy round shells of the scallops   the biggest danger is handling the gear on deck   mr  gilbert said   it is very heavy gear on a pitching deck  and you get a lot of injured feet  injured hands    once the scallops are sorted  according to industry regulations  they must be shucked by hand  the crew spends hours opening the shells and slicing out the abductor muscle of the mollusks      the fat  tasty morsel that winds up on plates at a restaurants like oceana in midtown manhattan  where a plate of sea scallops à la plancha costs as much as    a single boat can haul    pounds in a day  by the time the carolina queen ran aground  it was carrying only around    pounds  as the coast guard helicopter circled overhead  however  the scallops on ice below deck were not the most pressing concern  it was around   a  m   it was definitely a dangerous situation they were in   lieutenant bruno said   they had lost their generator and were taking on water  and i think that is when they made the decision that they had to come off    but how  as the helicopter approached the rockaways  the coast guard  in consultation with the fire department on shore  had come up with a plan  by then there were dozens of emergency workers on the beach  petty officer   the rescue swimmer  would be lowered into the surf to assess the situation  and if all went well  swim each stranded fisherman to shore  the fog was still thick as the helicopter made its first sweeping pass overhead  circling around a second time  the fog had cleared enough to put petty officer   into the water  petty officer   had joined the coast guard knowing he wanted to become a rescue swimmer  he had made up his mind after spending a summer working as an ocean lifeguard in kitty hawk  n  c  he completed aviation survival technician a school in december  and is now  at   a fully qualified rescue swimmer  in the course of his training  he had been part of scores of rescue drills  but he had never drilled on a ship that had run aground  as soon as he splashed down in the churning surf  it was clear that putting the fishermen into the water would not work   i swam in to shore  where the helicopter picked me up and then subsequently deployed me to the bow of the boat   he said   it was really rocking  bouncing back and forth     the ship was listing  degrees to port   he said   the crew was all dressed in their survival suits when i landed on the bow of the boat  they were very cooperative  several of them had small black garbage bags filled with personal effects that they asked if they could bring with them  they definitely seemed ready to leave    even if the rescuers had managed to rig some wires from ship to shore  which the fire department was prepared to do  the scallopers would have had to leap  to  feet into the water and then contend with waves more than  feet high   it had looked different from the air  but once i was on the ship it was clear that that plan would not work   petty officer   said  the coast guard decided to lift each of the seven stranded men from the boat using a rescue basket      a delicate operation   water was already in the hull  and the ship was moving in a way separate from the way the ocean was moving   recalled petty officer    lieutenant bruno hovered the helicopter some  feet above the vessel as petty officer   loaded the scallopers  one by one  into the basket  and one by one  they were ferried to shore  where the fire department was waiting  as morning broke  the helicopter had been airborne for more than two hours  and there were still fishermen on the ship  fuel was running dangerously low  time was running out  the seventh man      the captain      wearing jeans and a sweatshirt  was the last to leave the ship  he asked about remaining with the vessel but agreed in the end that it was best to go   his life being more valuable than a piece of equipment   petty officer   noted  as the captain was loaded into the basket  lieutenant bruno looked at his fuel gauge  he had four minutes left  with the captain safely deposited on shore and the mission complete  lieutenant bruno flew to floyd bennett field and set the helicopter down  all seven fishermen were safe and were transported to jamaica hospital medical center for observation  none was seriously injured  the ship  too  was salvaged  it is now being repaired at a shipyard in massachusetts  even the scallops on board were saved  they were sold to a dealer based in the brooklyn navy yard  petty officer   reflecting on the rescue  said it was both the easiest and the hardest he had ever taken part in   it was my first   he said    \n",

                                          chicago  reuters    illinois  democratic controlled house of representatives passed big  permanent increases in income tax rates and a   billion fiscal  spending plan on sunday with the help of some republican votes as the cash strapped state scrambled to stave off a bond rating downgrade to junk      the   billion tax package  which passed in a   vote and drew an immediate veto threat from republican governor bruce rauner  would boost the personal income tax rate to   percent from   percent and the corporate rate to  percent from   percent  it would also close tax loopholes and expand tax credits  the spending plan won passage in a   vote  both bills now head to the democratic led senate  which returns to session on monday  for concurrence votes  the country s fifth most populous state began an unprecedented third straight fiscal year on saturday without a complete budget  a fiscal stalemate between illinois  governor and democrats who control the legislature has pounded the state s credit ratings to a step above junk and ballooned its unpaid bill backlog to   billion  the pair of decisive house votes set democrats on a collision course with rauner  who vowed to veto the  percent personal income tax hike he pinned to house speaker michael madigan    the legislature could have passed a no reform budget like this one two years ago   rauner said in a statement   instead  they allowed mike madigan to play his political games  passed phony budgets  racked up our debt and inflicted pain on the most vulnerable   rauner has insisted for two years that a budget be coupled with a property tax freeze and legislative term limits  among other things  in order for rauner to match his tough words with results  he will have to persuade at least two of the  house republicans to switch their yes votes in favor of the tax hike legislation  the measure passed the house with one more vote than the threshold necessary to override a gubernatorial veto  in his own statement after the votes  madigan praised how republicans and democrats together took a  crucial step toward reaching a compromise that ends the budget crisis by passing a fully funded state budget in a bipartisan way   the tax legislation would give the state a revenue boost to support a full year budget and start paying down the bill pile that was on track to grow even larger after a federal judge on friday ordered increased payments on medicaid provider bills  in giving democratic supporters the narrow margin to move the legislation to the state senate  some house republicans shed tears during debate  predicted their tax votes could topple them politically in next year s elections and delivered a pointed challenge to rauner to set aside his budgetary preconditions and do what was right for the state s fiscal health   i say to the governor  if these bills pass the house and senate  the revenue bill and expenditure bill  we will have sent you a balanced budget  have the courage to do what is right and sign the bills   said state representative david harris  who was among  republicans to side with democrats   bring this madness to an end   their defiance came after house republican leader jim durkin  a rauner ally  noted the deal was not negotiated with the governor and did not represent  an exercise in good faith   given that negotiations involving some of the governor s non budgetary priorities were shunted to the sidelines     \n",

denis moynihan at t plans to buy time warner for    billion    mark lennihan   ap    it has been  years since alexander graham bell uttered the first words through his experimental telephone  to his lab assistant   mr  watson come here i want to see you   his invention transformed human communication  and the world  the company he started grew into a massive monopoly  at t  the federal government eventually deemed it too powerful  and broke up the telecom giant in   well  at t is back and some would say on track to become bigger and more powerful than before  announcing plans to acquire time warner  the media company  to create one of the largest entertainment and communications conglomerates on the planet  beyond the threat to competition  the proposed merger which still must pass regulatory scrutiny poses significant threats to privacy and the basic freedom to communicate  at t is currently no   on the forbes  list of the u s  s highest grossing companies  if it is allowed to buy time warner  no   on the list  it will form an enormous   vertically integrated  company that controls a vast pool of content and how people access that content  free press  the national media policy and activism group  is mobilizing the public to oppose the deal   this merger would create a media powerhouse unlike anything we ve ever seen before  at t would control mobile and wired internet access  cable channels  movie franchises  a film studio and more   candace clement of free press wrote   that means at t would control internet access for hundreds of millions of people and the content they view  enabling it to prioritize its own offerings and use sneaky tricks to undermine net neutrality   net neutrality is that essential quality of the internet that makes it so powerful  columbia university law professor tim wu coined the term  net neutrality   after the federal communications commission approved strong net neutrality rules last year  wu told us on the democracy now  news hour   there need to be basic rules of the road for the internet  and we re not going to trust cable and telephone companies to respect freedom of speech or respect new innovators  because of their poor track record   millions of citizens weighed in with public comments to the fcc in support of net neutrality  along with groups like free press and the electronic frontier foundation  they were joined by titans of the internet like google  amazon and microsoft  arrayed against this coalition were the telecom and cable companies  the oligopoly of internet service providers that sell internet access to hundreds of millions of americans  it remains to be seen if at t doesn t in practice break net neutrality rules and create a fast lane for its content and slow down content from its competitors  including the noncommercial sector  another problem that at t presents  that would only be exacerbated by the merger  is the potential to invade the privacy of its millions of customers  in   at t whistleblower mark klein revealed that the company was secretly sharing all of its customers  metadata with the national security agency  klein  who installed the fiber splitting hardware in a secret room at the main at t facility in san francisco  had his whistleblowing allegations confirmed several years later by edward snowden s nsa leaks  while that dragnet surveillance program was supposedly shut down in   a similar surveillance program still exists  it s called  project hemisphere   it was exposed by the new york times in   with substantiating documents just revealed this week in the daily beast  in  project hemisphere   at t sells metadata to law enforcement  under the aegis of the so called war on drugs  a police agency sends in a request for all the data related to a particular person or telephone number  and  for a major fee and without a subpoena  at t delivers a sophisticated data set  that can  according to the daily beast   determine where a target is located  with whom he speaks  and potentially why   where you go  what you watch  text and share  with whom you speak  all your internet searches and preferences  all gathered and  vertically integrated   sold to police and perhaps  in the future  to any number of at t s corporate customers  we can t know if alexander graham bell envisioned this brave new digital world when he invented the telephone  but this is the future that is fast approaching  unless people rise up and stop this merger   advertisement   \n",

           grand central terminal  the main building on ellis island and the enid a  haupt conservatory at the new york botanical garden      all among the greatest new york city landmarks      look better today than they have since their earliest years  many hands were responsible  john belle was the common denominator  mr  belle  the retired founding partner of beyer blinder belle  an architectural and planning firm that has specialized in preservation  restoration and contextual design  died last week at   with his death  the city has lost an architect who conveyed a genial joy in resuscitating the masterworks of his predecessors  that made him an appealingly modest figure in a room full of big architectural egos  since he was at his best when his own interventions were least obvious  new york has also lost a link to the intellectual crucible of the   when jane jacobs and others demanded that architects stop obliterating the past and  instead  take time to understand the many ways in which people were well served by older buildings and neighborhoods   preservation is one of the highest forms of good citizenship   mr  belle said on his firm s website   as a witness to the aftermath of the urban renewal movement in new york  i was determined to find a different way    for her part  ms  jacobs held beyer blinder belle in high regard   they were looking at the fabric of the community   she said in an interview in    that was very welcome and very exciting  that there were professionals who were  at last  doing that    she added   a community can t just come by waving a wand  it has history  history was  to the modernists  an enemy  so this was a very radical realization  and an important one    john belle was born on june     in cardiff  wales  his father  arthur  was a clerk at a lyons tea shop in cardiff  his mother  gladys  was a housewife  mr  belle received diplomas from the portsmouth school of architecture in england and the architectural association in london before moving to the united states in   once in america  mr  belle worked for josep lluís sert and victor gruen before starting his own firm in  with richard l  blinder and john h  beyer  mr  blinder died in   mr  beyer is still active  mr  belle s early work included community planning projects in manhattan  with the addition of james marston fitch to the practice in   beyer blinder belle began moving to the forefront of   architecture  the firm attracted wide attention in  with its renovation and restoration of the abandoned ellis island immigration station into the ellis island national museum of immigration  the vaulted ceiling in the former registry room  made of    guastavino tiles  was cleaned until it looked      as mr  belle aptly put it      like     where modern interventions were needed  they were made as inconspicuous and respectful as possible  when the haupt conservatory at the botanical garden in the bronx was restored in   herbert muschamp  who was then the architecture critic at the new york times  said it could  once again hold its sparkling glass head up high amid the great architectural symbols of new york    though critics have faulted beyer blinder belle s conservatism  it is worth recalling that the firm was associated in  with the daring architect santiago calatrava in what proved to be a losing bid to redesign the james a  farley building  also known as the general post office  as a pennsylvania station annex  penn station was not where mr  belle was to win his greatest renown  that was at grand central  you almost had to have been there in the  and   to believe how far the   terminal had fallen into decrepitude  even after its status as a landmark was upheld by the united states supreme court in   travelers shared grand central with a large homeless population   the building was divided into turf claimed by different drug dealers   mr  belle and maxinne r  leighton wrote in  grand central  gateway to a million lives     commuters were scared to take trains there at night  parents warned their children not to use the dangerous bathrooms    in   a design and engineering consortium led by beyer blinder belle began work  their strategic first strike was to demolish a billboard called the kodak colorama  which had blocked daylight into the main concourse for  years   it was as if life were being breathed back into the building   mr  belle and ms  leighton wrote   many commuters stopped in their tracks  speechless and amazed at the change that had so instantly brought back the majesty of the space    their astonishment increased as the concourse ceiling was cleaned by workers on a scaffold that was rolled slowly through the room over a   period  the mud brown sky turned a startling teal  with stars  constellations and zodiac signs popping out in   contrast  besides restoring the past  beyer blinder belle made fundamental changes  too  starting with the construction of an entirely new marble staircase to the east balcony  it echoed  but did not replicate  the ornate western staircase  some preservationists hated the idea  but the firm prevailed before city and state preservation agencies after it uncovered a plan by the original architects  warren  wetmore  that showed a staircase to the east balcony  that proved  mr  belle and ms  leighton wrote  that the idea  was not an   ploy to have our personal imprint on the building  but that in fact our goal was to complete the original design    mr  muschamp  the architecture critic  approved   the new eastern staircase  which threatened to diminish the room s amplitude  has the opposite effect of magnifying it   he wrote in   as the   million renovation neared completion  he continued   even more impressive is the uncovering of the ramps  located just behind the ticket windows  that lead down to the lower level and its fabled oyster bar     beyer blinder belle s greatest accomplishment   mr  muschamp said   has been to reveal that grand central is above all a monument to movement    mr  belle s first wife  wendy adams belle  an artist and teacher  died in   his second wife  anne belle  a documentary filmmaker  died in   he died on thursday in remsenburg  n  y  where he had a home  he also lived in manhattan  the cause was lewy body disease  said his son david belle  who survives him  along with another son  sebastian three daughters  amelia  fenella and antonia chapman and eight grandchildren  mr  belle knew his work would never fully be done   the act of restoring a building to its original state is only half the battle   he and ms  leighton wrote   the other half is to guard against its denigration throughout its future existence      \n",
